OPTIONS:

  There are two modes of operation, the default, which is to emit
  #define directives derived from specially formatted 'case' statements,
  and that with --local, which is to emit a static inline function
  mapping S_MAGIC_* values to 1, 0, -1, corresponding to known-local,
  known-remote/distributed/network and unknown, respectively.

   --local    emit an is_local_fs_type function
   --help     display this help and exit
   --version  output version information and exit
