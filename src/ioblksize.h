/* As of May 2014, 128KiB is determined to be the minimium
   blksize to best minimize system call overhead.
   This can be tested with this script:

   for i in $(seq 0 10); do
     bs=$((1024*2**$i))
     printf "%7s=" $bs
     timeout --foreground -sINT 2 \
       dd bs=$bs if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null 2>&1 \
         | sed -n 's/.* \([0-9.]* [GM]B\/s\)/\1/p'
   done

   With the results shown for these systems:
   system #1: 1.7GHz pentium-m with 400MHz DDR2 RAM, arch=i686
   system #2: 2.1GHz i3-2310M with 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, arch=x86_64

   Note that this is to minimize system call overhead.
   Other values may be appropriate to minimize file system
   or disk overhead.  For example on my current GNU/Linux system
   the readahead setting is 128KiB which was read using:

   file="."
   device=$(df --output=source --local "$file" | tail -n1)
   echo $(( $(blockdev --getra $device) * 512 ))

   However there isn't a portable way to get the above.
   In the future we could use the above method if available
   and default to io_blksize() if not.
