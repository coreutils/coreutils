/* As of Feb 2024, 256KiB is determined to be the best blksize
   to minimize system call overhead across most systems.
   This can be tested with this script:

   for i in $(seq 0 10); do
     bs=$((1024*2**$i))
     printf "%7s=" $bs
     timeout --foreground -sINT 2 \
       dd bs=$bs if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null 2>&1 \
         | sed -n 's/.* \([0-9.]* [GM]B\/s\)/\1/p'
   done

   Note that this is to minimize system call overhead.
   Other values may be appropriate to minimize file system
   overhead.  For example on my current GNU/Linux system
   the readahead setting is 128KiB which was read using:

   file="."
   device=$(df --output=source --local "$file" | tail -n1)
   echo $(( $(blockdev --getra $device) * 512 ))

   However there isn't a portable way to get the above.
   In the future we could use the above method if available
   and default to io_blksize() if not.

     This misinformation can cause coreutils to use wrong-sized blocks.
