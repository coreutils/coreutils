Here are most of the steps we (maintainers) follow when making a release.

* start from a clean, up-to-date git directory.

    git checkout master; git pull

* Run ./configure && make maintainer-clean

* Ensure that the desired versions of autoconf, automake, bison, etc.
  are in your PATH.  See the buildreq list in bootstrap.conf for
  the complete list.

* Ensure that you're on "master" with no uncommitted diffs.
  This should produce no output: git checkout master; git diff

* Ensure that you've pushed all changes that belong in the release
  and that the NixOS/Hydra autobuilder is reporting all is well:

      http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/coreutils-master

* Run bootstrap one last time.  This downloads any new translations:

    ./bootstrap

FIXME: enable excluded programs like arch? to get their manual pages?

* Check for new file system types by running the following command on
  a system with the most recent kernel possible, or with the latest
  upstream include/uapi/linux/magic.h made available at src/fs-latest-magic.h

    make src/fs-magic-compare

  If it reports new file system magic numbers, add them to src/stat.c.
  If it is a remote file system, add the new S_MAGIC_* name you created
  in stat.c to the list of remote file system types in src/tail.c's
  fremote function.

* Pre-release testing:

  Run the following on at least one SELinux-enabled (enforcing) and
  one non-SELinux system:

    n=$(( ($(nproc) + 1) / 2 ))
    sudo env PATH="$PATH" NON_ROOT_USERNAME=$USER make -k -j$(nproc) check-root\
      && make distcheck \
      && make -j$n check RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes

  If testing on systems with a non standard default shell, spurious failures
  may occur.  Often there are other shells available, and you can select
  those by using for example, SHELL=bash in the commands above.

  Note that the use of -j$n tells make to use approximately half of the
  available processing units.  If you use -jN, for larger N, some of the
  expensive tests are likely to interfere with concurrent performance-measuring
  or timing-sensitive tests, resulting in spurious failures.

  If "make distcheck" doesn't run "make syntax-check" for you, then run
  it manually:

    make syntax-check

* Set the date, version number, and release type [stable/alpha/beta] on
  line 3 of NEWS, commit that, and tag the release by running e.g.,

    build-aux/do-release-commit-and-tag X.Y stable

* Run the following to create release tarballs.  Your choice selects the
  corresponding upload-to destination in the emitted gnupload command.
  The different destinations are specified in cfg.mk.  See the definitions
  of gnu_ftp_host-{alpha,beta,stable}.

    # "TYPE" must be stable, beta or alpha
    make TYPE

* Test the tarball.  copy it to a few odd-ball systems and ensure that
  it builds and passes all tests.

* While that's happening, write the release announcement that you will
  soon post.  Start with the template, $HOME/announce-coreutils-X.Y
  that was just created by that "make" command.

Once all the builds and tests have passed,

* Run the gnupload command that was suggested by your "make stable" run above.

* Wait a few minutes (maybe up to 30?) and then use the release URLs to
  download all tarball/signature pairs and use gpg --verify to ensure
  that they're all valid.

* Push the NEWS-updating changes and the new tag:

    v=$(cat .prev-version)
    git push origin master tag v$v

* Announce it on Savannah first, so you can include the preferable
  savannah.org announcement link in the email message.

  From here:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/coreutils/
  click on the "submit news", then write something like the following:
  (If there is no such button, then enable "News" for the project via
   the Main -> "Select Features" menu item, or via this link:
   https://savannah.gnu.org/project/admin/editgroupfeatures.php?group=coreutils)

    Subject: coreutils-X.Y released [stable]
    +verbatim+
    ...paste the announcement here...
    -verbatim-

  Then go here to approve it:
    https://savannah.gnu.org/news/approve.php?group=coreutils

* Send the announcement email message.

* Approve the announcement here:
  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/admindb/coreutils-announce

* After each non-alpha release, update the on-line manual accessible via

    http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/

  by running this:

    build-aux/gnu-web-doc-update
