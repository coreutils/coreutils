	* NEWS: Likewise.

2002-07-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.1.

	* src/tail.c: Adjust command examples in comments to use
	POSIX 1003.1-2001 option syntax.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.
	From Paul Eggert.

2002-07-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.6b.

2002-07-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.22.

	* Upgrade to cvs automake -- required to work with 2.53b.
	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.6a.

	* Upgrade to gettext-0.11.3.
	* Upgrade to autoconf-2.53b.

2002-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cat.c, src/cksum.c, src/comm.c, src/csplit.c, src/cut.c (usage):
	Use the PACKAGE_BUGREPORT e-mail address, rather than hard-coding it.
	* src/expand.c, src/fmt.c, src/fold.c, src/head.c, src/join.c: Likewise.
	* src/md5sum.c, src/nl.c, src/od.c, src/paste.c, src/pr.c: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c, src/split.c, src/sum.c, src/tac.c, src/tail.c: Likewise.
	* src/tr.c, src/tsort.c, src/unexpand.c, src/uniq.c, src/wc.c: Likewise.

2002-06-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Invoke AC_GNU_SOURCE very early.

2002-06-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cksum.c: Include <sys/types.h> before system.h.

2002-05-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/od.c [struct dummy]: Renamed.  Don't rely on portability of
	zero-length arrays.  Instead, use sizes of -1 or +1.
	Reported by Eric Backus.

2002-05-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	`od -t f8' didn't work.
	This bug was introduced with my change of 2000-10-22 (textutils-2.0.8).
	* src/od.c (ulonglong_t): Move declaration to precede new use.
	[enum size_spec] (N_SIZE_SPECS): New member.
	(width_bytes): Add initializer corresponding to ulonglong_t type.
	(struct assert_width_bytes_matches_size_spec_decl): Declare.
	Based on a patch from Tony Kocurko.

2002-04-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use ENABLE_NLS only for gettext-related stuff, not also for
	setlocale-related stuff.  From a patch suggested by Bruno
	Haible.

	Since setlocale is now almost universal, this patch also
	removes some of the optimizations that clutter up the code and
	which don't help all that much even on hosts that lack
	setlocale.

	* lib/hard-locale.c: Upgrade to version used in GNU Diffutils 2.8.1.
	* m4/prereq.m4 (jm_PREREQ_HARD_LOCALE): Check for stdlib.h.
	Do not check for alloca.h (no longer used) or stdbool.h (was never
	used?).  Add AM_C_PROTOTYPES since hard-locale.h uses it.

	* src/sys2.h (HAVE_SETLOCALE): Define to 0 if not defined.
	* src/comm.c (compare_files): Replace #ifdef ENABLE_NLS
	with if (HAVE_SETLOCALE).
	* src/join.c (keycmp): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (keycompare, compare): Likewise.

	* src/comm.c (hard_LC_COLLATE): Define even if ! ENABLE_NLS.
	* src/join.c (hard_LC_COLLATE): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (hard_LC_COLLATE): Likewise.

	* src/comm.c (main): Always initialize hard_LC_COLLATE.
	Put initialization next to other locale-related stuff.
	* src/join.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/sort.c: Include <langinfo.h> even if ! ENABLE_NLS.
	(decimal_point, th_sep): Depend on HAVE_SETLOCALE, not ENABLE_NLS.
	(main): Likewise.
	(MONTHTAB_CONST): Remove; all uses removed.
	(struct_month_cmp, inittables): Do not depend on ENABLE_NLS.
	(main): hard_LC_TIME locale does not depend on ENABLE_NLS.

2002-04-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolescent_option): Do not limit the maximum
	line/byte count (when specified via obsolete option syntax) to be
	less than ULONG_MAX on systems where OFF_T_MAX is larger.

2002-04-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/tail.c (tail_forever): Do not treat
	max_n_unchanged_stats_between_opens specially (as if it were
	infinite) if it has its maximal value.  Similarly for
	max_n_consecutive_size_changes_between_opens.

2002-04-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Avoid new warnings from gcc.
	* src/pr.c [struct COLUMN] <name>: Declare member to be const.
	(init_fps): Declare local variable `firstname' to be const.

2002-04-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/wc.c (usage): Adjust ordering to match that of default output.
	Suggestion from Gaute Hvoslef Kvalnes.

	* configure.ac (AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Add external arg.
	(AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove intl/Makefile.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove intl.
	* src/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Remove -I../intl.

2002-04-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/tr.c (usage): Give a verbose description of --squeeze-repeats,
	including the mention of SET1.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2002-04-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (LDADD): List ../lib/libfetish.a both before
	and after @LIBINTL@.  Thanks to Paul Eggert for the fix and to
	Bruno Haible for diagnosing the problem.

2002-03-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (datadir): Don't override $(datadir)
	which might be set by --datadir and different from $(prefix)/share.
	Patch from Albert Chin-A-Young.

2002-03-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Specify the required version
	of automake (1.6), and options (gnits dist-bzip2), rather than...
	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): ...here.  Remove definition.

2002-03-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove config/config.rpath,
	now that automake knows about it.

2002-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add config/config.rpath.

2002-02-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/cat.c (simple_cat, cat, main): Use char * rather than
	unsigned char *, to avoid some technical violations of the C
	standard, and to avoid the need for casts.  I guess the
	unsigned char * was probably there for improved performance
	with ancient compilers, but the code wasn't using the
	unsignedness any more.
	Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	(cat): int -> size_t for full_write arg.  This doesn't
	fix any bugs since the buffer size is small, but it makes
	the code a bit clearer.

2002-02-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.21.

	* tests/tail/Test.pm: For tests matching /^(obs|err-[134])/,
	put _POSIX2_VERSION=199209 in the environment, so the tests succeed
	even when the environment would have contained _POSIX2_VERSION=200112.
	* tests/uniq/Test.pm (test_vector): Rename tests of obsolete usage
	to have prefix of `obs'.  Adjust environment for those tests as above.

	* tests/mk-script: When getting input via a pipe, apply the
	environment settings to the command in question, not to `cat'.
	No longer allow more than one element in the $Test::env or
	$Test::env_default arrays.  No caller used that feature.

2002-02-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/head/Test.pm: Accept pre-POSIX 1003.1-2001 options.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Likewise.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm: Likewise.

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Reflect new location of these files.

	* INSTALL: Update to Autoconf 2.52h.

	* src/Makefile.am (datadir): Use `share' in place of @DATADIRNAME@,
	per Gettext-0.11.
	(LDADD): Use @LIBINTL@ instead of @INTLLIBS@, per Gettext-0.11.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): New macro invocation.
	(ALL_LINGUAS): Remove: now in po/LINGUAS as per Gettext 0.11.

	* config: New subdirectory, containing the following files from .:
	config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, missing, install-sh, mkinstalldirs.
	Move the following files here from doc: texinfo.tex, mdate-sh.

2002-02-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for _POSIX2_VERSION, which lets you pick which POSIX
	version you want the utilities to conform to.  Remove warnings about
	failure to conform to a future POSIX version.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document _POSIX2_VERSION.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Standards Conformance): New section.

	an error and exit if the obsolete syntax is used and if conforming
	to the new standard.
	* src/fold.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/head.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (main, parse_obsolescent_option): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (STRINGS_OPTION, WIDTH_OPTION): Remove; no longer needed.
	All uses changed back to the corresponding short options.
	* src/pr.c (SEP_STRING_OPTION): Likewise.

	* src/od.c (main): Parse options using POSIX 1003.1-2001 rules if

	* src/pr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/system.h (_POSIX2_VERSION, POSIX2_VERSION): Remove definitions.
	(OPTARG_POSIX, OBSOLETE_OPTION_WARNINGS): Likewise.

2002-02-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/misc/split-a: New test for change of 2002-02-05.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add split-a.

2002-02-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/split.c (DEFAULT_SUFFIX_LENGTH): Define constant.
	(suffix_length): Use it here.
	(usage): Use it here.

2002-02-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Change 'split' to conform to POSIX.  It now accepts an -a or
	--suffix-length option, and refuses to generate more files
	than there are suffixes.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document this.

2002-02-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/misc/head-pos: New file/test for the change of 2002-02-08.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add head-pos.

	* src/tr.c (unquote): Make comment a little clearer.

2002-02-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/head.c (head_lines): If we have read too much data, try
	to seek back to the position we would have gotten to had we
	been reading one byte at a time.  POSIX currently doesn't
	require this, but it's easy to do and some software relies on it.

2002-02-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/uniq.c (main): Prepend `warning: ' to the diagnostic, so it's
	consistent with all of the other `... is obsolete...' diagnostics.

2002-01-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add more support for POSIX 1003.1-2001, which requires removal for
	support of obsolete "-N" option syntax in expand, head, fold,
	split, tail, unexpand, uniq, and which prohibits options with
	optional arguments in od and pr.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* doc/coreutils.texi: Likewise.

	* src/split.c (shortopts): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (shortopts): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (shortopts): Likewise.

	* src/expand.c (main): Check for obsolete options.
	* src/fold.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/head.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/od.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/pr.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/sort.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/split.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolescent_option, main): Likewise.
	* src/unexpand.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (main): Likewise.

	* src/head.c (header_mode_option): New constant.

	* src/od.c: New enum for long options.

	* src/pr.c (SEP_STRING_OPTION): New enum value.
	(long_options): Use it.

	* src/split.c (main): Use -1, not EOF, for getopt_long.

	* src/system.h (OPTARG_POSIX, OBSOLETE_OPTION_WARNINGS): New macros.

	* src/fold.c (main): Fix bug: -- -N was treated as -N --.

2002-02-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/tail.c (start_lines): Handle the case in which bytes_read is zero.

2002-01-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (ac-check): Remove, now that we no longer have
	to duplicate that information.
	(local-check): Remove ac-check.

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require automake-1.5d.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use zero-arg form of this macro.
	(ALL_LINGUAS): Add the bokmål dialect of Norwegian (nb).

2002-01-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	tail -n +2 would perform an extra read after encountering EOF
	* src/tail.c (start_lines): Detect EOF, inform caller.
	(tail_lines): Upon EOF in start_lines, return immediately.

2002-01-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.20.

2002-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/od.c (skip): Remove redundant check for overflow.
	fseeko's seek argument is already known to be in range,
	since it is less than the file size.

2002-01-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/xmemcoll.c.

2002-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/tac.c (save_stdin): Report proper errno value after
	fwrite failures.  Do not bother to rewind the temp file, as
	it'll be read backwards anyway.

2002-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ptx.c (swallow_file_in_memory): Work even if `open' returns 0.
	Check for `close' error.

2002-01-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Port to glibc 2.2.5, whose mmap stdio positions the underlying
	file descriptor at a nonzero offset after an fopen.

	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_MACROS): Require AC_FUNC_FSEEKO.
	* src/od.c (skip): Use fseeko rather than lseek.
	(Also, check for overflow when converting uintmax_t to off_t.)
	* src/sys2.h (EOVERFLOW, fseeko): New macros.

2001-01-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/comm.c: Include xmemcoll.h, not memcoll.h.
	Use xmemcoll instead of memcoll.
	* src/join.c: Likewise.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.

	* src/sort.c (die): Do not invoke cleanup; atexit does this now.
	(main): Use atexit to invoke cleanup on exit.
	Set xmemcoll_exit_failure to SORT_FAILURE.

2002-01-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/comm.c (compare_files): Don't assume that the difference
	between two size_t values can be stored in an int; this doesn't
	work, for example, on 64-bit Solaris.
	* src/sort.c (CMP_WITH_IGNORE): Likewise.
	* src/join.c (keycmp): Likewise.  Also, fix the type of two locals
	to be size_t instead of int.

2002-01-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/csplit.c: Don't include "xalloc.h", as system.h already
	does that via sys2.h.
	* src/sort.c: Likewise.

2002-01-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Remove code that set LIBOBJS in support of ansi2knr.
	The latest version of autoconf objected to it, and besides, I don't
	care too much about K&R support these days.

2002-01-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Fix tr so it no longer gets a failed assertion for [::] or [==].

	* src/tr.c (xmemdup): Rename from `substr' and rewrite to
	take only pointer/length parameters.
	(build_spec_list): Update sole caller.
	Properly diagnose the invalid specs [::] and [==].
	Pawel Prokop reported that `tr '[::]' x' elicits a failed assertion.
	* tests/tr/Test.pm: Add tests for the above fix.

2002-01-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (main):  Issue a warning for obsolete usage, unless
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	* src/tail.c (parse_obsolescent_option): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (main): Likewise.

2002-01-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for POSIX 1003.1-2001, which requires removal for
	support of obsolete "+" option syntax in sort, tail, and uniq.

	* NEWS: Document this.

	* src/sort.c (usage, main): Implement this.
	* src/tail.c (usage, parse_obsolescent_option): Likewise.
	* src/uniq.c (usage, main): Likewise.
	* src/system.h (_POSIX2_VERSION, POSIX2_VERSION): New macros.

	* src/sys2.h (ISDIGIT, S_ISVTX, S_IXUGO): Comment fix.

2002-01-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/misc/sort: New test, for just-fixed bug.
	* tests/misc/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add sort.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add PROG=$$tst.  This is a gross kludge
	that depends on the name of an automake-generated local variable.

2002-01-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (mergefps): Fix bug when eliminating empty files.
	Bug reported by James Hutt.

2002-01-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/help-version: Tweak to work with the programs in diffutils.

2002-01-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Add Turkish (tr).

2001-12-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (usage, specify_sort_size): Accept 'K' (which is
	now preferred, as it connotes 1024) as well as 'k'.
	* NEWS: Document this change.

2001-12-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/uniq.c (usage): Remove stray `)' in --help output.
	Reported by Padraig Brady.

	* Makefile.maint (real_dir): Remove unused variable.
	(url_dir_list): Don't set define it here, but...
	* Makefile.cfg (url_dir_list): ...define it here instead.
	(hosts, a_host, b_host): Remove now-unused variables.
	(alpha_subdir, a_url_dir, b_url_dir): Remove now-unused variables.

2001-12-12  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>
            Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/wc.c (wc): Use ISSPACE and iswspace in addition to hard-coding
	the ASCII space character.

2001-12-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.19.

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Remove ansi2knr.c, since it's
	no longer available at that location.

2001-12-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/od.c, src/tail.c, src/tr.c (usage): I will not split translatable
	strings in the middle of a sentence.  I will not split translatable
	strings in the middle of a sentence.  I will not split translatable
	strings in the middle of a sentence.  ...
	* src/join.c (usage): Merge lone "\n" into adjacent string.
	* src/md5sum.c (usage): Likewise.
	* src/paste.c (usage): Likewise.
	Reported by Karl Eichwalder.

2001-12-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (emit-upload-commands): Fix typo: s/distdir/PACKAGE/.

2001-12-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.18.

	* Makefile.maint (po-check): Check for uses of _() not just in .c
	files, but also in .h files.

	Ideally, there would be just one translation for all --help
	and --version description strings.  Before this change, they
	differed only in the number of blanks between the option name
	and the description.  Someday gettext may be smart enough
	to merge such strings and to reconstruct the proper spacing at
	run time.  In the mean time, now there is one string for each,
	and those descriptions in the --help output are no longer aligned
	with the others.
	* src/sys2.h (HELP_OPTION_DESCRIPTION): New macro.
	(VERSION_OPTION_DESCRIPTION): New macro.

	as a warning from Irix 6.5's C compiler.

2001-11-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cksum.c (usage): Indent --help and --version strings to
	start in the 7th column.
	* src/pr.c (usage): Likewise.

2001-11-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Factor out some common strings to make translation easier.

	Suggestion from Karl Eichwalder.

	* src/ptx.c (main): Don't split copyright string in the middle
	of a sentence.

2001-11-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.17.

	csplit could get a failed assertion: printf 'a\n\n'|csplit - '/^$/' 2
	* src/csplit.c: No longer include assert.h.
	(process_line_count): Remove invalid assertion.  The test that caused
	the failure has been in the code since before 1992-11-08, but since

	lseek failed.  Fix that.

2001-11-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/tail.c (file_lines): Add a parameter, start_pos.
	Work properly even when the read pointer is not at beginning of file.
	(tail_lines): Call file_lines for any regular file, as long as lseek
	can be used to seek to its end, not just when the initial read pointer
	is at beginning of file.

2001-11-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/tail.c (tail_lines): Move declaration of local `length'
	into scope where it's used.
	(tail_file): Likewise for local `stats'.

	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add proc-ksyms and start-middle.
	* tests/tail-2/start-middle: New test, for the bug fixed on 1995-07-24.

	`tail /proc/ksyms' would segfault on Linux.
	* src/tail.c (tail_lines): Use status of lseek (...SEEK_END) call
	in deciding whether to call file_lines or pipe_lines.
	From Herbert Xu.

	misleading anyway.
	(bsd_sum_file): Avoid unsigned and long when they're not needed.
	Compute total input bytes as uintmax_t, not long, so that the
	code works even with files whose size does not fit in 'long'.
	(sysv_sum_file): Likewise.
	(sysv_sum_file): Do not reduce checksum until the end; this is

	tail -F would segfault
	* src/tail.c (parse_options): Add missing `break;' from last change.

2001-09-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Tell automake to use the file name `config.hin'
	rather than the two-`.' config.h.in.

2001-09-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* man/Makefile.am (common_dep): Define it, so we depend on configure.ac.

	* configure.ac: Renamed from configure.in.

2001-09-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (sort_DEPENDENCIES): Remove definition altogether.
	It adds nothing to the existing: $(PROGRAMS): ../lib/libfetish.a.

2001-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (sort_DEPENDENCIES): Depend only on
	../lib/libfetish.a, not on $(LDADD), since the latter may
	contain `-lintl'.  This resembles yesterday's patch for the
	`$(PROGRAMS)' rule.

2001-09-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.15.

	* src/Makefile.am ($(PROGRAMS)): Depend only on ../lib/libfetish.a,
	not on $(LDADD), since the former may contain `-lintl'.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): When using newer gettext (in which
	intl/libintl.h is created by rules intl/Makefile)
	`intl' must precede `lib'.

2001-09-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* ABOUT-NLS: Upgrade to gettext 0.10.40
	* intl: Upgrade entire directory to gettext 0.10.40
	* po/ChangeLog: New file.

	* Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Remove definition, since intl/libintl.h
	is no longer created via configure.

	* tests/od/od-N: New test for the 2001-09-19 fix by Ian Bruce.
	* tests/od/Makefile.am: New file.
	* tests/od: New directory.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add od.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/od/Makefile.

2001-09-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/od.c (MAX_ADDRESS_LENGTH, pseudo_offset, format_address,

	format_address_std, format_address_paren,
	format_address_label, write_block, parse_old_offset, dump,
	dump_strings, main):
	Use uintmax_t, not off_t, for file addresses, so that we can
	handle multiple large files even if the sum of their sizes
	exceeds off_t limits.

	(print_s_char, print_char, print_s_short, print_short,
	print_int, print_long, print_long_long, print_float,
	print_double, print_long_double, dump_hexl_mode_trailer,
	print_named_ascii, print_ascii, decode_one_format):
	Use size_t, not off_t, for in-memory byte counts.

	(end_offset): New var.
	(dump, dump_strings): Use it.
	(main): Set it, but check for overflow while doing so.

	(skip): Report an error if an in-range lseek fails on a
	regular file, as something's seriously wrong.  Check for
	negative regular file sizes (possible with some broken NFS
	implementations).

	(parse_old_offset): Now all offsets are valid, so return a
	success boolean and take a pointer to an offset as an argument.
	All callers changed.

	(dump_strings): Check for overflow when computing end_offset -
	string_min.

	(main): Remove OFF_T_MAX checks that are no longer needed.
	Don't bother assigning through temporary when there's no size
	limit to check.

2001-09-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/od.c (open_next_file): Use SETVBUF, not setbuf.
	(skip): Revert part of last change: use lseek, not fseek.

	When --read-bytes=N (-N N) is used, disable input buffering in
	the standard I/O library.  Otherwise, od would read more input
	than requested.  This could have caused problems when reading
	from pipes, character devices, or open file descriptors inherited
	from a parent process.

	* src/od.c (open_next_file): New function, factored out of...
	(skip): Adapt to use open_next_file.
	(read_char): Likewise.
	(read_block): Likewise.
	(main): Likewise.
	(dump): Fix an off-by-one error that could have made od fail to
	report a read error when reading from a named file (not stdin).
	(check_and_close): Account for the fact that in_stream may now be NULL.
	(usage): Correct descriptions of -j and -N options.
	Patch by Ian Bruce.

2001-09-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require automake-1.5.

	* man/Makefile.am: Revamp this file, as for fileutils.

	* src/md5sum.c (digest_check): On systems for which setmode actually
	does something, arrange to read the file containing checksum strings
	in text mode.  Based on a patch from Chris Faylor.
	* src/system.h (SET_MODE): Define.

2001-09-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	The command `echo a|./fmt -2147483647' would cause fmt to segfault.
	* src/fmt.c (fmt_paragraph): Test for sentinal directly, rather than
	doing arithmetic with it's potentially large (INT_MAX) length.
	* tests/fmt/basic: Add tests for the above.

	tail: accept new option: -F, equivalent to `--follow=name --retry',
	for compatibility with FreeBSD and NetBSD versions of tail.

	* src/tail.c (usage): Describe new option.
	(parse_options): Accept it.
	Patch by Christian Kurz, via Herbert Xu.

	The command `echo foo|fmt -w N' for N>=32K would cause fmt to segfault.

	* src/fmt.c [struct Word]: Declare members length, space, and
	line_length to be of type `int', not short.
	(MAXCOST): Define using TYPE_MAXIMUM.
	Reported by Herbert Xu.

2001-08-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/fmt.c (bool): Remove typedef, now that it's in system.h.
	(TRUE): Define to `true', not 1.
	(FALSE): Define to `false', not 0.

2001-08-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/cat.c: Include full-write.h.
	(full_write): Remove decl; not needed.
	* src/split.c: Likewise.

	* src/cat.c (simple_cat, cat):
	Don't assume read and write size fits in int.

2001-08-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/fmt.c (main): Correct the diagnostic for invalid argument to -w.
	(main): Diagnose an invalid, old-style width option.

2001-08-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint: Undo last change.  Instead, simply remove `N_(',
	since the `Copyright ...' line should not be translated.

2001-08-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (copyright-check): Update to reflect fact that
	the copyright year is now defined separately.

2001-08-08  Charles Randall <crandall@matchlogic.com>

	* src/sort.c (mergefps): Do not allocate at least sort_size
	bytes for each merge buffer.  Instead, allocate at least
	sort_size bytes total.

2001-08-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Re-enable some commented-out tests.

2001-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/uniq.c (main): Fix a typo in the previous patch: missing
	a bounds check for examples like `uniq a b c'.

	* uniq.c (main): Fix some more incompatibilities with POSIX.2,
	(e.g. `uniq +3 --' did not work) by invoking getopt_long with
	leading '-', resembling what was done to 'sort' on 2001-03-20.
	Recognize an +N option only if it is an integer in range, and
	(if POSIXLY_CORRECT) only if a file name argument has not been seen;
	otherwise silently treat it as a file name.

	If the user specifies too many operands, output the first one
	in the error message, as a diagnostic aid.

2001-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/uniq.c (main): Don't report an error when given the
	valid options `+3 -d'.

2001-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/uniq.c (different): Don't assume that lengths can fit
	into size_t.  Tune code for the common case where the line
	lengths differ: we avoid comparing them entirely in that case.

2001-08-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Add tests for -s 0 and -w 0.

2001-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Remove arbitrary restrictions on sizes, fixing a bug reported
	by Geoff Whale.

	* src/uniq.c (skip_fields, skip_chars, check_chars): Now size_t,
	not int.
	(size_opt): New function.  Do not arbitrarily reject size zero.
	Change the wording of the error message slightly, for convenience.
	(find_field): Use size_t, not int, to compute sizes.
	(different, main): check_chars==0 is no longer a special case, as
	it defaults to SIZE_MAX.
	(main): Check for overflow with args like -234234234234234.
	Use 'size_opt' to convert optional arguments to sizes.

2001-08-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/uniq/Test.pm: Add new test, #54, for the just-fixed bug.

2001-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/uniq.c (find_field): Don't count trailing newline to be
	part of the field.  This disagrees with POSIX.2, but it's
	gotta be a bug in the standard.  An interpretations request
	has been submitted to PASC.
	Reported by Geoff Whale.

2001-08-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint: Merge in changes from autoconf.

	* Makefile.maint ($(v_etc_file)): Define.
	(copyright-check): Use the new variable.
	(my-distcheck): Depend on local-check so those checks are once
	again run by `make distcheck'.

	* src/head.c (head_bytes): Read no more than the specified
	number of bytes.  Patch by Ian Bruce.

	* tests/misc/head-c: New test for the above.

	the new, generated file, unlocked-io.h.

2001-08-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mk-script ($program_name): Define.
	(main): Use $program_name, rather than long-inaccurate `build-script'.
	(main): Iterate over the sorted keys (rather than `while...each...'),
	so this script produces the same output regardless of which version
	of perl (e.g., perl5.6) is used.

2001-08-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add Makefile.cfg.

	* Version 2.0.14.

	* configure: Regenerate using a patched copy of autoconf-2.49e to
	work around a bug in its test for a working memcmp function.

2001-03-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/cksum.c: Fix bugs when computing length of large files.
	Add overflow and write error checks.  Use uint_fast32_t, not
	unsigned long, to do checksum calculation, as C99 says
	uint_fast32_t should be no slower and might be faster.

	Include <stdio.h> and "system.h" even if CRCTAB is defined,
	so that the code will compile if CRCTAB is defined.
	Include "human.h" if CRCTAB is not defined.
	(uint_fast32_t): Define if it appears that stdint.h didn't.
	(BIT, remainder, main, crctab): Use uint_fast32_t, not unsigned long,
	for checksums.
	(fill_r, remainder, main): Use ANSI prototypes.
	(fill_r, remainder, main): Omit duplicate code.
	(main): Use uintmax_t, not unsigned long, for file lengths.
	Use size_t, not long, for result of fread.
	Check for overflow when computing file lengths.
	Check for write error immediately after printing a line, so that
	we don't write to stdout indefinitely after an error.

2001-04-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (default_sort_size): Leave a 1/16 margin for RSS.
	Suggestion from Solar Designer.

2001-04-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/wc.c (usage): Tweak --help output: s/line,/newline,/

2001-04-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c (main): Add a comment justifying the use of
	`multi-character' rather than `multibyte' in a diagnostic.
	From Paul Eggert.

2001-04-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (RLIMIT_AS): Do not define; just use conditional
	code, since RLIMIT_RSS is similar (and is not standardized).
	(default_sort_size): Don't allocate more than the RSS limit,
	if this host has such a limit.

2001-03-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/textutils.texi: sort now accepts long options and
        checks POSIX option syntax.

	* doc/textutils.texi: Document --, -, sort long options, and
	sort -o after files.

	* src/sort.c: Include <getopt.h>.
	(usage, main): Add support for long options, and check option
	syntax as POSIX requires, though (as usual for GNU apps)
	options can follow file names unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
	Many diagnostic revamped.
	(long_options): New constant.
	(badfieldspec): New arg MSGID.  Mark as noreturn.
	(parse_field_count): New arg MSGID; if null, just return null on error.
	(new_key): Renamed from key_init.  All callers changed.  Now allocates
	the new key.

2001-03-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.13.

	* tests/Fetish.pm: If the $DJDIR envvar is defined, set SHELL
	to $DJDIR/bin/bash.exe.  Patch from Richard Dawe, based on a
	suggestion from Eli Zaretskii.

2001-03-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c, src/tail.c, src/uniq.c (usage):
	Warn that the +N form will be withdrawn.
	* doc/textutils.texi: Likewise.

2001-03-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/textutils.texi: Document pr changes.

	* src/pr.c: Include mbswidth.h.
	(standard_header, header, test_suite): Remove.
	(date_format, date_text, file_text, header_width_available): New vars.
	(long_options, main, init_header, usage):
	Add new -D or --date-format option.
	(CHARS_FOR_DATE_AND_PAGE, T_BUF_FMT, T_BUF_SIZE, NO_DATE): Remove.
	(init_header): Allow arbitrary width for date format.  Change
	"Page %5d" to "Page %d", since the code no longer assumes fixed width.
	Do not assume that localtime succeeds.
	(init_header, print_header, usage): Do not truncate headers.
	(init_header, print_header): Defer width calculations until
	page is printed, since "Page 100000" is wider than "Page 1".
	Count columns, not bytes, in page headers.
	Custom headers take up only the center, not the whole header.
	(print_header): Use printf rather than fprintf(stdout).

	* po/Makefile.in.in (install-data-yes): Install LC_TIME locale
	for all packages, not just for fileutils.
	(uninstall): Remove LC_TIME locale too.

	* src/sys2.h (INT_STRLEN_BOUND): New macro.

	* tests/pr/0F, tests/pr/0FF, tests/pr/2-S_f-t_notab,

	Adjust to minor spacing changes in pr headers.

2001-03-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (die): New message arg, to describe failures
	better.  All callers changed.

2001-03-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Decrease buffer size when only merging or checking.
	(sort_size): Now the user-specified sort size.
	(MIN_MERGE_BUFFER_SIZE): New macro.
	(MIN_SORT_SIZE): Use it.
	(merge_buffer_size): New variable.
	(fillbuf): Increase merge_buffer_size if a longer line is encountered.
	(checkfp, mergefps): Do not allocate a buffer smaller than
	merge_buffer_size.
	(sort): Use the default_sort_size if sort_size is zero.
	(main): Do not set sort_size to default_sort_size.

2001-03-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (sort): If all the input files are empty, create
	an empty output file.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm: Test for this.

2001-03-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c (merge): Move declarations of local variables into
	the inner scope where they're used.
	(sort): Likewise.

2001-03-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@sic.twinsun.com>

	Avoid the need for a copy of the input file when the input and
	output overlap, e.g. 'sort F -o F'.  With -m, though, a copy
	is still needed sometimes.

	* doc/textutils.texi: 'sort F -o F' no longer needs to copy F.

	* src/sort.c: Do not include closeout.h.
	(xfopen): Use stdout if *how != 'r'.
	(mergefps): Remove FPS arg.
	Open all input files, and close all files when done.
	If OFP is null, open the output file (but after opening input files).
	All callers changed.
	(first_same_file): New function.
	(sort, merge): Remove arg OFP; we now open the output file as needed.
	All callers changed.
	(merge): New arg MAX_MERGE.  All callers changed.
	(sort):	For "sort F -o F", close the input before opening the output.
	(main): Do not use close_stdout; 'sort' and 'merge' now close stdout.
	(This also fixes a close-stdout-twice bug.)
	Remove test for overlapping input and output files, as 'sort' no longer
	needs to worry about overlap, and 'merge' checks for overlap itself.
	Use first_same_file to inform 'merge' about how much to merge at
	the top level, to avoid overlap.

2001-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	`fmt --prefix=S' would not work properly for any string S containing
	a byte with the high bit set.
	* src/fmt.c (prefix): Declare to be of type unsigned char, not `char'.
	(get_prefix): Likewise for local, `p'.
	Reported by François Pinard.

	Add a test for the above-fixed problem.
	* tests/fmt: New directory/files.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/fmt/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add fmt.

2001-03-05  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/tac.c (save_stdin): Use mkstemp to create temporary file.

2001-03-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (my_distdir): Define new variable, and use this
	in place of most old uses of $(distdir).

	* tests/help-version: Ensure that /dev/full is a character device
	(using test -c) as well as being writable, before trying to write to it.
	Otherwise, the test could mistakenly append a newline to an existing,
	regular, writable, /dev/full file.
	Suggested by Ulrich Drepper.

2001-03-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/sha1sum/sample-vec: Insert the `--text' argument for each test.
	Reported by Matthew Smith.

2001-03-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (my_distdir): Define.
	Use it in place of $(distdir) almost everywhere.

	* Version 2.0.12.

	* Makefile.maint (alpha): Use $(PACKAGE)-$(VERSION), not $(distdir),
	since the latter now has a `$(top_distdir)/' prefix.

2001-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (die): New function.
	(create_temp_file, xfopen, xfclose, write_bytes, sort_buffer_size,
	fillbuf, main): Use it to regularize error messages.  The only change
	in behavior is that write_bytes and the final close used to say "write
	error" but now give just the output file name, which should be enough.

2001-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (xfclose): Add FILE arg, and report the file name
	on error.  All callers changed.

2001-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (main): When fclose (stdin) fails, do not mention
	the output file in the error message; mention "-" instead.

2001-02-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (xfopen): Set have_read_stdin to 1 only if file is "-".
	Use fopen_safer, not fopen, to avoid subtle bugs when fopen returns
	stdin, stdout, or stderr.
	(xfclose): stdout is no longer a special case.
	(main): Close output file, don't just flush it; there might be
	an error on the close.

2001-02-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (initbuf): If the desired size cannot be
	allocated, repeatedly halve it until allocation succeeds.
	Reported by Solar Designer.

2001-02-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (parse_field_count): Comment fix.

2001-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Tune allocation and comparison of nodes
	representing temp files.  This improved CPU performance of
	'sort -S 1 *.[ch]' by 17% on my host.

	(struct tempnode): name member now uses struct hack.
	(temphead): Now a pointer, not a structure.  All uses changed.
	(create_temp_file): Allocate node using struct hack.
	(zaptemp): Free node using struct hack.  Use pointer comparison, not
	string comparison.

2001-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (eolchar, trim_trailing_blanks): Now static.

2001-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	'sort' race condition fixes.

	Defend against a DoS attack where someone else creates a
	temporary file with the same name as ours.  Use mkstemp to do
	this, supplying our own mkstemp if the system doesn't have one.

	Also, fix a race condition during cleanup on hosts without
	sigaction.

	* src/sort.c (NAME_MAX_IN_DIR): Remove.
	(sigprocmask, sigset_t): New macros, defined only on older hosts.
	(caught_signals): New var.
	(xtmpfopen, tempname): Removed.
	(create_temp_file): New function, combining the functions of the old
	xtmpfopen and tempname.  All callers changed.
	Use mkstemp to create the file.
	(sighandler): On hosts without sigaction, ignore signals while
	cleaning up, instead of letting them interrupt cleanup.
	(main): Initialize caught_signals.  On hosts with sigaction, block all
	caught signals while handling one.  Remove duplicate code.

2001-02-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c (keycompare): Move declarations of locals, lena and lenb,
	into the inner scope where they are used.

2001-02-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c (AUTHORS): Add Paul Eggert.

	* src/wc.c (wc): Rename innermost `buf' to avoid shadowing warning.
	(wc): Rename local `wc' to avoid shadowing function name.

2001-02-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix a race condition: freed storage accessed during a signal handler.

	* src/sort.c (struct tempnode.next): Now volatile.
	(zaptemp): Free the file name after removing it from the temp list,
	not before, because a signal can arrive between the two actions
	and cleanup () traverses the list.

2001-02-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Check for input size, and do not overallocate memory.
	Also check for memory quotas.

	Revamp storage management so that line tables and character data are
	taken from the same buffer.  Line tables are now in reverse order,
	since they grow down while the character data grow up.

	* src/sort.c:
	(<sys/resource.h>): Include if HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H.
	(struct rlimit, getrlimit): Define a replacement if RLIMIT_DATA
	is not defined.
	(RLIMIT_AS): Define to RLIMIT_DATA if not defined.
	(struct lines): Remove.
	(struct buffer): New members nlines, line_bytes, eof.
	Remove member newline_free; no longer needed, since the code no longer
	runs out of line table space.
	(SORTALLOC_MIN, SORTALLOC_DEFAULT_MIN): Remove.
	(sort_size): Renamed from sortalloc; now applies to the sum of the
	character data and the line table, not just the character data.
	(MIN_SORT_SIZE, INPUT_FILE_SIZE_GUESS): New macros.
	(linelength): remove.
	(specify_sort_size): Don't worry about the distinction between the
	character data and the line table; that is now the caller's
	responsibility.
	(default_sort_size): Return the value, instead of being executed for
	side effect.  Return half of available memory, or 1/16 of total memory,
	whichever is greater; except do not exceed 1/2 of quota.
	(sort_buffer_size): New function.
	(initbuf): New arg LINE_BYTES.  Ensure that the line array is properly
	aligned.  Initialize the new set of struct buffer members.
	(buffer_linelim): New function.
	(fillbuf): Return int, not size_t, since the callers merely care
	whether the result is nonzero.  New arg FILE so that error messages
	can report the file name.  Keep track of eof.  Initialize the line
	table too, taking its memory from the input buffer's memory; this
	subsumes the old findlines function and removes the need for worrying
	about running out of line table entries.
	(checkfp, mergefps, sortlines, merge, sort): Adjust to the new storage
	management regime, in particular the fact that line tables are now
	filled in by fillbuf and are in reverse order.
	(checkfp): Now takes char *, not const char *, since subroutines
	require that now.  Rewrite to avoid lint and duplicate code.
	If line length alloc calculation overflows,
	simply allocate enough memory to hold the line.
	(mergefps): New arg FILES, used for buffer size calculation and error
	messages.  Rewrite to avoid lint.  Do not loop if savealloc*2
	overflows.
	(mergefps, merge): Zap temporary files eagerly rather than lazily;
	this is needed because we now pass FILES to mergefps.
	(sortlines): Args now point at end of arrays, not at beginnings.
	(sort): Do not allocate temporary line array for sortlines;
	instead, take the space from the same buffer.
	(main): Adjust to sort_size and default_sort_size changes.

2001-02-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Rename test input files to avoid conflicts on case-insensitive
	file systems.
	* tests/pr/2-Sf-t_notab: Rename from 2Sf-t_notab.
	* tests/pr/2-S_f-t_notab: Rename from 2S_f-t_notab.
	* tests/pr/W-72l17f-ll: Rename from W72l17f-ll.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Update file names to reflect renamings.
	Reported by Matthew Smith.

2001-01-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in: Remove jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES.
	Now it's invoked by jm_MACROS.

	* src/cksum.c (main): Use PACKAGE, not GNU_PACKAGE.
	* src/tsort.c (main): Likewise.

2001-01-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/od.c (ulonglong_t): Define place-holder type to avoid some #if
	directives.
	(LONGEST_INTEGRAL_TYPE): Remove definition.
	(MAX_INTEGRAL_TYPE_SIZE): Use ulonglong_t instead of
	LONGEST_INTEGRAL_TYPE.
	(print_long_long): Compile this function even on systems without
	long long support.
	(decode_one_format): Remove #if directive.

	* src/od.c (decode_one_format): Guard use of print_long_long with
	`#if HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG'.  From Darren Salt.
	Change all `#ifdef HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG' to use `#if' instead.

2000-12-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sys2.h [HAVE_INTTYPES_H]: Include <inttypes.h>.

2000-12-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 2.0.11.

2000-12-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	(specify_sort_size, default_sort_size): New functions.
	(initlines): Do not let alloc exceed limit.
	(findlines): Likewise.
	(checkfp, mergefps, sort): Use sortalloc to size everything
	else, instead of relying on precomputed sizes.

2000-12-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update from master repository.
	* config.sub: Likewise.
	* config.guess: Likewise.

	* src/od.c (address_base, address_pad_len): New var.
	(output_address_fmt_string, address_fmt_buffer, address_pad): Remove.
	(flag_pseudo_start): Now int, not long int.

	(format_address_none): Do not even print the extra char argument.
	This simplifies the callers.

	(OFF_T_MAX): Likewise.

2000-12-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

2000-11-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/od.c (skip): Use lseek instead of worrying about fseeko or fseek.
	This should be portable, as we seek before doing any I/O.

2000-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c: s/SIZE_T_MAX/SIZE_MAX/.

2000-11-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sys2.h: Include <stdint.h> if HAVE_STDINT_H.

	All uses changed.

2000-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sort.c: SIZE_MAX is not defined, so s/SIZE_MAX/SIZE_T_MAX/, and...

	(sort): Don't allocate tmp until we need it (and know the right size).

	(parse_field_count): New function.

	(main): Use it to check for overflow in field counts.

	* src/cat.c (LINE_COUNTER_BUF_LEN): Define to allow numbering as
	many as 10^18 - 1 lines (the old limit was 10^11 - 1, and could
	be exceeded without too much trouble).	Use this symbol rather

	* src/comm.c (writeline): Correct comments.  From Bruno Haible.

2000-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/textutils.texi:

	Portable shell scripts should specify global options before
	key fields.

	Move global LC_CTYPE remark to each sort option that depends
	on LC_CTYPE.

	sort -g depends on LC_NUMERIC.

	Add @vindex where it's missing.

	"radix character" -> "decimal-point character", to match Standard C
	terminology, which is easier for most people to follow.

	"comm" does not consider trailing newlines to be significant.

2000-08-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/textutils.texi: Recommend against the System V syntax
	for tr ranges, and don't use it in examples.  Use POSIX
	classes rather than ranges, for portability.
	* src/tr.c (usage): Don't describe System V syntax, as it
	doesn't always work.

	* src/sort.c (usage): Describe -d and -i in a locale-independent way.

	New case for MB_CUR_MAX > 1. A non-printable non-space character does
	not increment the line position or start a word. Update `total_bytes'.
	(main): Initialize `print_bytes' and `total_bytes' to 0. Accept 'm'
	option. Pass `total_bytes' to write_counts.

2000-08-04  Greg McGary  <greg@mcgary.org>

	* src/tail.c (pipe_lines): Add variable `nbytes' so we can free
	`tmp' immediately after read loop.  Don't process an empty file.

	`while' loop where it's used.

2000-03-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@set.twinsun.com>

	Big performance improvement when sorting many small files,
	building on a suggestion by Charles Randall.

	* src/sort.c (fillbuf): Skip memmove if it would be a no-op,
	as many memmove implementations are slow in that case.
	Don't examine leftover bytes for eolchar, since they may be left
	over from a previous file, and we want to read from this file.

	(sort): At end of file, if there is more input and buffer room,
	concatenate the next input file.

2000-02-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in: Remove lib-check for cposix now that we use
	m4/isc-posix.m4.
	(jm_LIB_CHECK): Use this even though the library checks aren't
	required for this patchage (so all three lib/Makefile.in files
	will be the same).

2000-01-24  Mark Kettenis  <kettenis@gnu.org>

	* src/tsort.c (exit_status): New variable.
	(loop): New varibale.
	(count_items, scan_zeroes): Change return type to int.
	(detect_loop): Complete rewrite to correctly implement detection

	(recurse_tree): Stop if ACTION returns non-zero.  This involves
	changing the return type of this function and ACTION to int.
	(walk_tree): Change return type of ACTION to int.
	(tsort): Continue sort after a loop has been detected (and
	broken).  Set exit_status to 1 if a loop was detected.

	(findlines, keycompare, CMP_WITH_IGNORE, compare, checkfp, mergefps,
	sort): Tune and use a more consistent style for reallocation.
	(keycompare, main): Don't worry about LC_CTYPE;
	it's buggy with multibyte chars anyway.
	(compare): Invoke alloca (0) after each call to keycompare,
	not just the ones that return nonzero.  This avoids a memory
	leak on architectures without builtin alloca that occurs
	sometimes when a file contains all duplicate lines.

2000-01-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/csplit.c (interrupt_handler, main):
	Don't use SA_INTERRUPT to decide whether to call sigaction, as
	POSIX.1 doesn't require SA_INTERRUPT and some systems
	(e.g. Solaris 7) don't define it.  Use SA_NOCLDSTOP instead;
	it's been part of POSIX.1 since day 1 (in 1988).
	* src/sort.c (sighandler, main): Likewise.

2000-01-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

2000-01-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove these: memcpy memset stpcpy
	strpbrk strtol strtoul.  Now that's in m4/.

	unexpand could infloop
	* src/unexpand.c (TAB_STOP_SENTINEL): Define.
	(unexpand): Use it instead of INT_MAX.

	Reported by John Kodis.

2000-01-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (fillbuf): Avoid quadratic behavior with long lines.
	Also, stop worrying about ancient memchr bug (misbehavior when

	Sync lib/ directories of sh-utils, and textutils.

2000-01-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/tsort/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add `pwd`/ prefix

	* tests/tail-2/assert: Tell the user just before sleeping for 7 seconds.

	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove fflush test.  It didn't

	* Version 2.0a.

	* lib/Makefile.am (lstat.c): Adapt rule to handle new parts of xstat.in.

1999-12-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Move 120+ lines of stat.h-related macros from system.h (not shared)
	to sys2.h, which is shared between fileutils, sh-utils, textutils.
	* src/system.h: Move them from here...
	* src/sys2.h: ... to here.

1999-12-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/tail-2/fflush: New test for latest change.
	* tests/tail-2/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fflush.

1999-10-26  Marc Boucher  <marc@mbsi.ca>

	* src/tail.c (main): Flush stdout before switching to unbuffered mode
	and calling tail_forever.  Required only on Solaris 5.7 -- on other
	systems, using setvbuf to switch to unbufferd mode does the flush.

1999-11-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Put $(BUILT_SOURCES) here rather
	than in $(MAINTAINERCLEANFILES).

	* configure.in: Move some type/header/member tests into
	m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES) so they are shared by all of
	fileutils, textutils, and sh-utils.

1999-11-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	(LINEALLOC): Increase from 0.25 to 4 MB.

1999-11-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, doc/textutils.texi:
	Do not consider newline to be part of a line when comparing lines
	in `sort' and `comm'.  POSIX.2 requires that we consider newline,

	* src/sort.c (begfield, limfield, findlines, keycompare, compare):
	Likewise.
	* tests/sort/Test.pm:  Update tests `use-nl' and `11d' to reflect

	byte after the newline; it's no longer needed.
	* src/sort.c (sortalloc, mergealloc, fillbuf, checkfp, mergefps):
	Likewise.

	* lib/memcoll.c (memcoll): The two arguments cannot be
	adjacent any more, so remove the alloca/copy workaround for
	that case.

1999-11-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Fix so that `tail -fn 2 file' works again.
	* src/tail.c (anonymous enum) [LONG_FOLLOW_OPTION]: Define.
	(long_options): Use LONG_FOLLOW_OPTION here, instead of 'f'.
	(main): Remove the `::' after the `f' in getopt_long string.
	Add `case LONG_FOLLOW_OPTION' after `case 'f':'.
	Based on a patch from Tim Waugh.

	* src/tail.c (anonymous enum) [RETRY_OPTION]: Define.
	[MAX_UNCHANGED_STATS_OPTION]: Likewise.
	[MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SIZE_CHANGES_OPTION]: Likewise.

	This file is shared by fileutils and sh-utils, both of which still
	have the file (albeit nearly empty now).
	Suggestion for clean-up from Akim Demaille.

1999-11-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Set to $(BUILT_SOURCES).

	* src/tail.c (tail_forever): When following by name and calling recheck
	because of exceeding max_n_consecutive_size_changes_between_opens,
	`continue' so we don't fall through and (assuming the file finally grew)

	* Version 1.22p.

	AC_REPLACE...'d in m4/jm-macros.m4.

	(main): Set posixly_correct from the POSIXLY_CORRECT envvar.

	document.  Change all uses and locals like was_missing to was_tailable.
	Invert expressions as appropriate.
	(reopen_inaccessible_files): Rename from allow_missing.
	(sleep_interval): Describe.
	(--allow-missing): Deprecate.
	(--retry): New option, equivalent to --allow-missing.
	(usage): Document name vs. descriptor differences.
	Refer to manual for descriptions of --max-unchanged-stats=N
	and --max-consecutive-size-changes=N.
	(valid_file_spec): New function.
	(recheck): Assert valid_file_spec.
	Remove dead else-if block (suggestion from Eli Zaretskii).
	Adjust stmts that set f->tailable -- unlike for `missing', tailable
	doesn't depend on errno == ENOENT.
	(parse_options): Give a warning if --retry is used when not following
	by name.

	* tests/join/Test.pm: New test case (but commented out) for
	Paul's 1999-06-01 fix.

	* tests/join/Test.pm: New test case for Paul's 1999-06-03 fix.

1999-07-03  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* src/tail.c (struct File_spec): New member, errnum.
	(recheck): Record the new value of errno in f->errnum.  Don't
	output an error message unless the new value of errno differs from
	the old one.  Output a message if previously-inaccessible file
	becomes accessible.
	(tail_forever): Always recheck files whose fd is negative.  If the
	file cannot be fstat'ed, record the errno value in f[i].errnum.
	(tail_file): If the file cannot be open, record the errno value in
	f->errnum.  If it can be opened, initialize f->errnum to zero.  If
	it's a non-regular non-fifo file, initialize f->errnum to -1.

1999-06-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

1999-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/linebuffer.c (readline): Leave room for an extra byte
	after the newline; comm needs this for memcoll.

1999-06-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add LC_COLLATE support to `join'.

	* doc/textutils.texi: Describe join and LC_COLLATE.

	* src/join.c: Add support for LC_COLLATE locale.
	Include hard-locale.h, linebuffer.h, memcoll.h.

	All uses changed.
	(hard_LC_COLLATE): New var.
	(main): Initialize it.
	(get_line): Use readline to read the line,
	instead of doing it by hand.
	That way, we get a buffer that we can pass to memcoll.
	(keycmp): Use memcoll to compare lines if hard_LC_COLLATE is nonzero.

1999-05-27  Volker Borchert  <bt@teknon.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Qualify .env-warn with $(srcdir)/ prefix.

1999-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add LC_COLLATE support to `comm', so that `comm' is compatible
	with `sort' in nontrivial locales.

	* doc/textutils.texi: Document locale-specific mode for comm.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libtu_a_SOURCES): Add hard-locale.c, memcoll.c.

	replacing `need_locale'.
	(memcoll): Move to lib/memcoll.c.
	(keycompare): No need to alloc (0), since our caller now does it.
	(compare): alloca (0) before returning.
	(my_setlocale): Remove; hard_locale now dows this.
	(main): Invoke setlocale, bindtextdomain, and textdomain before
	invoking anything that might print an error.
	Use hard_locale to determine which locales are hard.

	* lib/hard-locale.c, lib/hard-locale.h, lib/memcoll.c, lib/memcoll.h:
	New files.

1999-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@shade.twinsun.com>

	* lib/linebuffer.c (readline):
	Append trailing newline to line.
	* lib/linebuffer.h
	[struct linebuffer] (size): Declare to be of type size_t, not long.
	[struct linebuffer] (length): Likewise.
	* src/comm.c, (writeline): Lines now contain trailing newline.
	* src/uniq.c (find_field, different): Use size_t, not int, for lengths.
	(writeline): Lines now contain trailing newline.
	(check_file): Use size_t, not int, for lengths.
	* src/nl.c (proc_text, check_section, main): More of the same.

	Likewise.
	src/uniq.c (find_field, different, check_file): Likewise.

	* lib/linebuffer.c (readline): Silently append trailing
	newline if needed.  Do not bother setting buffer length to 0
	at EOF, since it's not part of the spec and nobody relies on
	it.  Do not compute the difference between unrelated pointers.

1999-05-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/tac.c (memrchr): Ifdef out this unused function.

1999-05-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* doc/textutils.texi (Squeezing): Remove misleading square brackets
	from SET1 in the one-word-per-line example.

1999-05-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/Makefile.am (libtu_a_SOURCES): Remove memchr.c.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

	* Version 1.22m.

1999-05-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/textutils.texi: Document locale-specific changes to `sort',
	as well as the new, POSIX-compliant definition of line comparison,
	and -g's more careful treatment of NaNs, infinities and zeros.

	* src/sort.c (general_numcompare): Put exceptional cases
	first, not last, to be consistent with -M.

1999-05-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (strtod): Declare if STDC_HEADERS is not defined.
	(general_numcompare): Use strtod, not xstrtod.
	Do not consider partial conversions to be errors.
	Put -infinity at the start, and +infinity at the end;
	follow +infinity with NaNs (sorted by bit pattern),
	and finally by conversion errors.

1999-05-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/sort/Test.pm (11d): Reverse lines in expected output
	to reflect latest change.
	(use-nl): New test from Paul Eggert.

1999-05-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Treat the trailing newline as part of the line,
	as required by POSIX.2.

	(struct line, findlines, compare, checkfp, mergefps, sort):
	A line now includes its trailing newline.
	(findlines): Do not replace newline with NUL.
	(memcoll, keycompare): Work even if the data to be compared are
	adjacent strings; this is possible now that lines contain the
	trailing newline.
	(fillbuf): Always have an unused byte at the end of the	buffer,
	since memcoll and keycompare want to modify a byte after the last line.
	(sortalloc, mergealloc): Increase by 1, for trailing byte.

1999-05-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/sort/Test.pm: Add test case from Paul Eggert.

1999-05-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (keycompare): Ignore any length difference if the
	localized comparison says the strings are equal.

	* src/sort.c (memcoll, keycompare, compare): Handle NUL
	characters properly when comparing with LC_COLLATE semantics.
	(NLS_MEMCMP): Remove.
	(memcoll): Renamed from strncoll.
	Take separate lengths for each string.
	This function is now invoked only when need_locale.
	(keycompare): Don't copy strings when ignore and translate
	are both NULL.

1999-05-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (MONTHTAB_CONST): Renamed from NLS_CONST; the use
	is also changed.  Define to const also if !HAVE_NL_LANGINFO.

	(usage): `,' -> `;' (English typo).

1999-05-17  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* src/cat.c (main): When stdout is in binary mode, make sure all
	input files are also read in binary mode.

1999-05-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Version 1.22l.

1999-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c: Don't autodetect the locale of numbers and
	months, as this conflicts with POSIX.2 and is tricky to boot.

	(FLOATING_COMMA, NLS_STRNCMP, NLS_MAX_GROUPS,
	NLS_ONE_CHARACTER_STRING): Remove macros no longer used.

	(nls_grouping, nls_fraction_found, nls_month_found, nos_monthtab,
	nls_months_collide, nls_keyhead, us_monthtab): Remove variables no
	longer used.

	(struct nls_keyfield): Remove types no longer used.

	(strncoll_s2_readonly, nls_set_fraction, look_for_fraction,
	nls_month_is_either_locale, nls_numeric_format): Remove functions no
	longer used.

	(monthtab): Now has the role that us_monthtab had, but it's const only
	if ENABLE_NLS is not defined.

	(C_DECIMAL_POINT): Renamed from FLOATING_POINT.  All uses changed.
	(MONTHS_PER_YEAR): Renamed from NLS_NUM_MONTHS.  All uses changed.
	(struct_month_cmp): Renamed from nls_sort_month_comp.  All uses changed.
	Use strcmp, not strcoll, since the user doesn't care about collating
	here.

	(inittables): Read locale data into monthtab, rather than modifying a
	separate month table and futzing with indirection.  Do not worry about
	colliding months, since we no longer autodetect month locale.

	(fraccompare): Don't set no-longer-used variable nls_fraction_found.

	(getmonth): Use strncmp to compare months, since user doesn't care
	about collating here.  Fix bug where code incorrectly assumed that
	strlen (monthtab[lo].name) == strlen (monthtab[ix].name).

	(keycompare, main): Don't autodetect month locale.

	(compare): Don't use NLS_MEMCP in code that can't be executed if
	need_locale is false, as NLS_MEMCP is equivalent to memcmp in that
	case.

	(sort, insertkey, main): Don't autodetect numeric locale.

1999-05-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/join/Test.pm (trailing-sp): New test for this fix.
	* src/join.c (xfields): Don't interpret a trailing blank as a
	delimiter when e.g. -t: was specified.  From Tim Smithers.

1999-05-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (envvar-check): Renamed from check-local.
	(check): Depend on envvar-check so the envvar check is performed
	before all other tests.  Reported by Volker Borchert.
	* tests/.env-warn: Use `%%' place-holder that Makefile.am rule expects,
	so CDPATH is mentioned in the message.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

1999-05-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/sort.c (usage): Split the --help message into two pieces so that
	neither is longer than 2048.  For Irix4's cc.  Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

1999-05-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/regex.c: Update from libc.

	* Version 1.22k.

1999-05-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/system.h (CHAR_BIT, TYPE_SIGNED, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_MAXIMUM,
	and all the *_MIN and *_MAX symbols): Remove definitions.
	* src/sys2.h: Put the definitions here instead (this file is shared
	between all three *utils packages, while system.h is not).

1999-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (fraccompare, numcompare): Merge the NLS and
	non-NLS versions into a single function.

	(decimal_point): Now char, since we no longer convert to unsigned
	char.
	(th_sep): Now int, since we use a value out of char range to denote
	the absence of a thousands separator.
	(IS_THOUSANDS_SEP): New macro.
	(USE_NEW_FRAC_COMPARE): Remove.
	(nls_set_fraction): Arg is now char, not unsigned char.
	Set th_sep to CHAR_MAX + 1 if there is no thousands separator.
	(numcompare): Don't convert to unsigned char unless necessary.
	(main): Turn off decimal points and thousand separators if they
	are multibyte characters, as we don't support that yet.

1999-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/system.h (CHAR_MIN, CHAR_MAX): New macros.
	(SCHAR_MIN, SCHAR_MAX): Don't assume that char is signed.

1999-05-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sort.c (numcompare): Handle comparison of two negative
	numbers correctly in the ENABLE_NLS case.

1999-05-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/pr.c (usage): Break the usage message into 3 pieces instead of
	only 2.  The strings had grown to be longer than 2048, which evokes
	errors when compiling with Irix4's cc.  Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

	* src/tsort.c (search_item): Use `1' instead of `+1'.  The latter
	elicits a syntax error from SunOS4's cc.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

1999-05-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/ptx.c <ctype.h>: Don't include.
	[!STDC_HEADERS]: Remove definitions of ctype macros.
	Convert e.g., isspace to ISSPACE to use definitions from sys2.h.
	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

	* src/sys2.h (TOLOWER): Define.
	(TOUPPER): Define.
	* src/join.c (TOLOWER): Remove definition.

	* src/sort.c (usage): s/DIRECT/DIRECTORY/g
	Rename global: s/temp_file_prefix/temp_dir/.
	(NAME_MAX_IN_DIR): Rename from PATH_MAX_IN_DIR.  Use _POSIX_NAME_MAX,
	not _POSIX_PATH_MAX.  Guard with #if HAVE_PATHCONF rather than
	#if HAVE_UNISTD_H.
	(tempname): Wrap after 99999 only for length-impaired file systems.

1999-04-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/tail.c (file_lines): Fix serious bug introduced with last changes.
	From Andreas Schwab.

1999-04-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Rename .posix-warn to .env-warn.
	(check-local): Warn about CDPATH in the same way
	we warn about POSIXLY_CORRECT, since the cp/same-file test fails at
	least when using bash with CDPATH set.  Reported by Mark Hewitt.

	* src/pr.c Add comments.
	(init_header): Tweak white space in Date/Time header.
	* tests/pr/Test.pm: Updated all tests to reflect the big

	this instead.

1999-03-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	(noinst_HEADERS): Add version-etc.h.

1999-03-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/tail.c (recheck): Factor out a block of duplicated code.
	Set f->size to 0 upon encountering a new file so we read it from
	the beginning rather than from the end of the first line or
	block.  Otherwise, after a log rotation, tail would omit the first
	line or block of the new file.  Reported by Ed Avis.

1999-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Temporarily remove pr.

	* src/tail.c (dump_remainder): Don't fflush stdout here.
	(main) [if forever]: Make stdout unbuffered, instead.
	Akim Demaille pointed out that when running `echo x>a; tail -f a>>a' ,
	the file `a' didn't grow longer than two lines.  Now it grows
	without bound.

1999-03-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/md5sum/newline-1: Test for the actual feature.
	With help from Eli Zaretskii.

	* src/pr.c (usage): Add missing \n\.

	The newline test would always fail on MSDOS/Windows systems --
	so move it to a separate file where we can test for that.
	* tests/md5sum/basic-1: Remove newline test.
	* tests/md5sum/newline-1: New file.
	* tests/md5sum/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add newline-1.

	new options -J, -S, -W to disentangle -s and -w when used together
	with the three column options;
	(add_line_number): Make POSIX compliant; use default number
	separator TAB with single column output.
	(add_line_number): Make POSIX compliant; with multicolumn output
	now prefer `text columns of equal width' rather than a consequent
	use of `default n-separator TAB'.
	(add_line_number): Change line number cut-off from lower-oder to
	higher-oder digit to avoid loss of information; no consequent
	handling exists in different utilities and other UNIXes.
	(char_to_clump): Expand input text tabs to 8 spaces, if
	input_tab_char doesn't equal TAB (adapted to other UNIXes).
	(usage): Update POSIX compliant options -s, -w; add new options -J,
	-S, -W.
	(main): Update the source internal documentation.
	Some smaller BUGFIXES (print_sep_string, init_header, skip_to_page,
	reset_status, print_header).

	* tests/md5sum/basic-1 (backslash): Use .\foo instead of \.foo so we
	don't tramp on root directory in MSDOS/Windows.
	Suggestion from Eli Zaretskii.

	1999-02-15  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* tests/md5sum/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Run md5sum with the

	* src/tr.c (main): Make sure c1 is not -1 before using it as an
	array index.  Patch from Greg McGary.  Although this is truly a
	bug, I believe it would not cause tr to misbehave on most systems.
	I could not construct a test case with which this bug causes tr
	to generate invalid output.

	* tests/pr-test/Test.pm: Add test that -o 0 works.

	* src/pr.c (main): Allow use of 0 (zero) as the margin offset

	to avoid shadowing local variables.

	local variables.

	* src/*.c: Compare getopt_long return value against -1, not EOF.

	(parse_options): Remove unnecessary goto and label.

	* tests/sort-test/mk-script.pl: Interpret `input arg is a hash
	reference' as meaning that the tested program will read no input.

	(_STRTOL_ERROR): Undefine.

	* lib/xstrtol.c (__xstrtol): Change interpretation of
	VALID_SUFFIXES == NULL vs VALID_SUFFIXES == "".  Use the former
	when any suffix is valid, the later when no suffix is allowed.

Fri Jan 24 23:36:00 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/long-options.c (parse_long_options): Reset optind to zero

	* acinclude.m4 (jm_SYS_PROC_UPTIME): Fix typo in cache variable
	name for cross compiling.

	Reported by Markus Demleitner.

Sat Nov 23 16:07:08 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/sort.c [!ENABLE_ASSERTIONS]: Guard NDEBUG definition.
	(checkfp): Fix off-by-one error that resulted in writing one byte
	beyond the end of a malloc'd buffer.  It caused `sort -c' to segfault
	on Linux systems having a relatively recent libc.  Before, running
	the command, perl -e "print 'x' x 30, \"\n\";"|sort -c
	would provoke the memory overrun (though not necessarily the failure).
	Add an assertion.
	Reported by Risto Kankkunen.

	* src/md5sum.c (usage): Remove references in --help output to
	the now-deprecated --string option.  Support for it will be

	md5sum.c could leave the option in and accommodate the alignment
	restriction, but this option was intended solely for testing, and
	the tests are now all file-oriented, so it's not necessary.

	* tests/md5sum-test/md5-rfc: Rewrite to avoid use of --string option.

	when verifying checksums.
	Reported by Eli Zaretskii <eliz@is.elta.co.il>.

	* sort.c (main): Give a better diagnostic for `sort -0'.
	Reported by Karl Berry.

	a single file and it gets a read error or checksum mismatch as when
	there are more.  Write that warning to standard error, not standard
	output.  Suggestions from Greg Troxel (gdt@b-sgi.bbn.com).

Thu Oct 26 00:11:35 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* sort.c (xtmpfopen): New function to set proper permissions on

	Close input files.

Fri Oct  6 23:10:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* join.c (main): Report `too few/many non-option arguments'
	then print --help output rather than just the latter.
	Properly interpret obsolescent usage like `join -o 2.1 2.1 2.2'.
	(usage): Describe POSIX -1, -2 options and deprecate -j* ones

	* join.c (usage): Move to precede all other functions.

	* join.c: Protoize.

Tue Oct  3 22:44:05 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* csplit.c, sort.c, tac.c: Test SA_INTERRUPT, not _POSIX_VERSION,
	to determine whether `sigaction' functions are available.
	Reported by Paul Nevai <nevai@ops.mps.ohio-state.edu>.
	Fix suggested by Karl Berry.

	* md5sum.c (main): Declare counter, N_STRINGS, to be an integral

Tue Sep 26 23:05:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in (install-data, uninstall): Use sed not basename.
	The GNU Coding Standard suggests that only a select set of
	relatively standard utilities be used in Makefiles.  basename is
	not among them.  Suggested by Ulrich Drepper.

Sun Sep 24 08:36:47 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cksum.c: Protoize.
	* cut.c: Protoize.

	Rename --verbose to --warn, --quiet to --status.
	(main): Handle --help and --version using parse_long_options.
	(md5_check): Check ferror.

	* sort.c (tempname): Replace `16' with a more readable expansion.

	Move a couple dcls from function scope into inner block.

Tue Aug  8 21:49:27 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c (main): Fail if either --verbose or --quiet is specified
	when not verifying checksums.

	* md5sum.c (md5_check): Fail if no valid line is found.
	Don't use the word `fail' unless there were failures --
	instead, say `all N tests passed.'

	* md5sum.c (main) [handling --string option]: Don't output
	nonstandard `b' binary flag.  From Greg Troxel (gdt@bbn.com).
	* md5-test.rfc: Remove now-inconsistant `b' marker.
	(usage): Clarify help message.  With suggestions from Greg Troxel.

Mon Aug  7 23:27:54 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	From Franc,ois.

Mon Aug  7 00:02:59 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h (_): Define macro -- as empty for now.
	* src/*.c: Annotate localizable strings with _(...).  From Franc,ois.

Sat Aug  5 23:51:25 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Add fp_C_PROTOTYPES.

Fri Aug  4 23:21:46 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Include ansi2knr.c and ansi2knr.1.
	Add suffixes, dependencies, and rules to convert ANSI source to K&R
	when required.  Mark tr.o and comm.o as the only such files (for now).

	* tr.c: Protoize.
	* comm.c: Protoize.

	* Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add aclocal.m4 and acconfig.h.
	(configure): Depend on aclocal.m4.
	(stamp.h.in): Depend on aclocal.m4 and acconfig.h.

Sun Jul 30 00:01:58 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c (md5_check): Use getline instead of fgets.

	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add getline.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add getline.o.
	(DISTFILES): Add getline.h.
	(getline.o): Depend on getline.h.

	* md5.c [memcpy]: Define to bcopy if needed.
	(md5_buffer): Explicitely cast SWAP expressions to unsigned
	to avoid warning.

	* lib/Makefile.in (strtoul.o): Depend on strtol.c.

	* sort.c (check): Print `disorder on...' message on standard error,
	not stdout.  This is a minor concession to POSIX which says
	`no output shall be produced...'.

	* sort.c (main): Fix -k so it works. -k 2,3 was being treated
	like -k 2.  Reported by Marcus Daniels <marcus@sysc.pdx.edu>.

Wed Jul 26 22:54:48 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in (install, uninstall): Strip off `.1', not just `1'
	before applying $(transform) to manual name.  From Karl Berry.

	* md5sum.c (have_read_stdin): New global variable.
	(md5_file, md5_check): Set it.
	(main): Use it.

	* md5sum.c [OPENOPTS]: Depend explicitly on BINARY.
	(md5_file): Take a new parameter, MD5_RESULT, and no longer
	generate output.
	(md5_check): Invoke md5_file instead of calling fopen directly.
	When giving a diagnostic for a line with invalid format, also report
	the line number.
	(main): Generate output after a successful md5_file call.
	[in many places]: Upon detection of an error, rather than exiting
	immediately, issue a diagnostic, note that an error occurred and
	exit later.

Mon Jul 24 21:48:26 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (tail_bytes) [from_start]: For regular files, seek
	relative to the initial input file pointer position, not
	necessarily from the beginning of the file.
	[!from_start]: Don't back up past the initial position of the
	input file pointer.
	(tail_lines): Call file_lines only if FD refers to a regular file
	with its file pointer positioned at beginning of file.  Otherwise,
	call pipe_lines.  This is a kludge.  Once there's a decent test
	suite, fix this properly.
	Before, (echo 1; echo 2) > k; sh -c 'read x; tail' < k
	would output both lines of the input file even though the first had
	already been read.  Reported by John Roll (john@panic.harvard.edu).

	* md5sum.c [_LIBC || STDC_HEADERS] (TOLOWER): Define to tolower.

	* csplit.c (main): When too few arguments are given, don't just
	issue the usage message; also report why.

Sat Jul 22 00:16:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c (md5_check): New function -- extracted from main.

Fri Jul 21 01:21:49 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c (md5_file): New function -- extracted from main.
	(main): Call the new function instead of doing all that in an
	if-stmt. Always use "%s" format rather than raw filename as
	format argument in printf-style functions like error.  Otherwise,
	filenames containing `%' are likely to lose.
	Remove all mention of `old format'.
	(split_3): No longer parse the `new format.'  There is only one
	valid format now: the compatible one.

	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add md5.c.
	(OBJECTS): Add md5.o.
	(DISTFILES): Add md5.h.
	(md5.o): Depend on md5.h.

	* system.h [!EXIT_FAILURE, !EXIT_SUCCESS]: Define them.
	* lib/md5.c (md5_stream): Check for read failure and return
	indication of success rather than second argument.
	* lib/md5.h (md5_stream): Update prototype.
	[__P]: Define macro.
	* md5sum.c: Use EXIT_FAILURE and EXIT_SUCCESS.
	(main): Report an error if md5_stream fails.  Otherwise, running
	`md5sum dir-on-mounted-filesystem' always reported the checksum
	for an empty file.  Now it gets the `is a directory' error.
	Greg McGary (gkm@magilla.cichlid.com) reported that the released
	version got stuck in an infinite loop with such arguments.

	* lib/md5.c: New file.
	* lib/md5.h: New file.
	* md5sum.c: Rewritten to use library interface.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

Sun Jul 16 18:42:34 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Add AC_C_INLINE: md5sum.c uses inline keyword.

Tue Jul 11 21:56:02 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c Add #else block after #ifdef VMS.
	(main): Rename local variable.
	Detect and report failed fclose calls on stdout and checkfile_stream.

	* tr.c (unqote): Comment out unreachable break stmts.
	(append_range): Declare FIRST and LAST parameters to be unsigned int,
	not size_t.
	(find_closing_delim): Clean up interface, separating boolean success
	indicator and index.
	(find_bracketed_repeat): Likewise.
	(build_spec_list): Adapt to use new interfaces.
	Declare CLOSING_DELIM_IDX and CLOSING_BRACKET_IDX to be of
	type size_t, not int.
	(main): Declare NR and CHARS_READ to be of type long, not int.

	* sort.c (main): Comment out unreachable break stmt.

	* tail.c (tail): Explicitly cast to long the N_UNITS argumennt in
	call to tail_lines.  Otherwise, NetBSD lost because N_UNITS (of type
	off_t, a 64-bit type on NetBSD) wasn't converted to the target type,
	long.  Reported by Dan Hagerty (hag@gnu.ai.it.edu).

	* comm.c: Reorder functions so main is last, so no forward dcls
	are needed.

Sun Jul  9 11:41:15 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* sort.c (main): When using obsolescent +pos -pos syntax, allow
	omission of field spec only when character offset is specified.
	Otherwise, -. +. would be accepted.

Sat Jul  8 13:48:06 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* sort.c (main): Allow field spec, M, to be omitted in +M.N or -M.N
	position specification.  For compatibility with existing practice
	(what vendors?), omitting M is now equivalent to specifying `0' for M,
	but only when using the +pos -pos syntax, not with the -k option.
	From Rick Sladkey (jrs@world.std.com).

Thu Jul  6 23:44:20 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* od.c (dump): Correct loop-termination criterion.
	Before, running `printf 1234| ./od --width=4 --read-bytes=4'
	printed output for 8 bytes -- the last four were garbage.
	This happened only when the dump limit, N, was specified (with
	--read-bytes=N) and N was a multiple of bytes_per_block
	(usually 16, but 4 in this example).  From Andreas Schwab.

Sun Jul  2 22:12:40 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* lib/Makefile.in (check): Depend on libtu.a.

	* md5sum.c (split_3): Rewrite to parse Plumb/Lankester format as well.
	(main): Print each sum line in (de facto) standard Plumb/Lankester
	format.
	New option: --quiet.
	Check option no longer takes an argument.
	When checking, exit status reflects success.

Sat Jun 24 16:18:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c [__GNUC__]: Don't conditionalize use of "inline".
	Autoconf (via config.h) defines it away for compilers that don't
	grok it.

	* cat.c, comm.c, join.c, sort.c, uniq.c: Undefine min/max before
	defining to avoid redefinition warning on some systems.

	* csplit.c (read_input): Rename paramater MAX to MAX_N_BYTES.
	This avoids potential conflict with max macro from some system's
	header files when using bad pre-ANSI compilers.

	* uniq.c (usage): Fix typo in text of --help output.
	From Steve McConnel <steve@acadcomp.sil.org>

	* md5sum.c [uint32]: When testing for 32-bit arithmetic type,
	also check `unsigned long', as a concession to systems with
	int's smaller than 32 bits.

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove memcmp (again!) since
	AC_FUNC_MEMCMP already handles it.  This avoids warnings from
	ranlib on nextstep systems.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* csplit.c (interrupt_handler): Declare to have a single integer
	parameter.  Otherwise, some compilers fail with a type mismatch
	error in sa_handler assignment.

	* fmt.c [word]: Redefine.  Otherwise, systems (Unicos for one) with
	headers that typedef `word' get syntax errors because of the
	variable by the same name.

	* join.c [join]: Redefine to avoid conflict with prototype in some
	system header file.  Also for Unicos.

	* md5sum.c (main): Remove spurious colon in getopt spec string.
	From Ken Pizzini <kenp@spry.com>.

Tue Jun 20 06:59:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c (md5_file): Initialize two elements of LEN portably,
	rather than with ANSI aggregate initialization.  Reported by
	Edzer Pebesma <Edzer.Pebesma@rivm.nl>.

Sun Jun 18 09:15:57 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.12.

	* md5sum.c (process_buffer): Copy values from struct into
	individual local variables before performing computation on them,
	then copy results back into returned struct.  Solely for better
	optimization by compilers that can't keep struct members in
	registers.  From Ulrich Drepper.

Thu Jun 15 22:09:14 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c: Remove unnecessary uses of `defined' in #if* tests.
	Don't use #elif.  Some older compilers don't grok it.
	(split_3): New function to parse out sum, flag, and filename
	when reading check file.
	(hex_digits): Remove length parameter since string parameter is
	now nul-terminated.
	(main): Don't allocate separate arrays for filename and sum
	when checking.  Get pointers into line buffer with split_3 instead
	of using sscanf.
	(main): Treat `no file args' just like `-' when not checking
	or using strings.
	(hex_digits): Unprotoize.

	* md5sum.c (main): Don't use a separate loop to convert to lower
	case.  Suggested by Ulrich Drepper.
	(CLOSE): New macro.
	(md5_file): Use it.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

	* md5sum.c: Don't include values.h.
	[__P]: Undefine it.

	* md5sum.c: [UNIX || unix]: Also test __UNIX__, __unix__,
	and _POSIX_VERSION.  Reported by Arne H. Juul.

Tue Jun 13 21:20:10 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tr.c [NDEBUG]: Define it to disable assertions.  Some systems
	have a broken <assert.h> header.
	(is_char_class_member): Set a variable in each branch of switch
	stmt and return that value after the switch (rather than returning
	directly from every branch).
	(unquote): More int->size_t changes.
	(build_spec_list): More int->size_t changes.
	Be very careful about comparison now that variables are unsigned:
	Use i + 2 < len rather than i < len - 2.  The latter didn't work
	for len < 2.  Caught early thanks to a thorough regression test
	suite.

Mon Jun 12 23:07:59 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* sort.c (xfclose): Don't try to flush stdin, only stdout.
	Otherwise, at least Ultrix-4.3's fflush would return EOF.
	Reported by Jim Blandy (jimb@cyclic.com).

	* tr.c (non_neg_strtol): Don't compare signed and unsigned.
	[struct Spec_list] (indefinite_repeat_element): New member.
	Use size_t rather than int or unsigned long where reasonable.
	(get_spec_status): Make interface cleaner.
	(get_s1_spec_status): New function.
	(get_s2_spec_status): New function.
	(validate): Use new functions instead of get_spec_status.

Sun Jun 11 00:39:50 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* md5sum.c: New file.  From Ulrich Drepper.

	* tr.c (look_up_char_class, append_char_class, append_equiv_class):
	Use const attribute when appropriate.

Sun May 28 14:48:58 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* join.c: Overhauled to make -a1 and -a2 options work.
	Passed all tests in a fairly thorough test suite.
	Reported by Michael Hasselberg (mikelh@zonta.ping.de).

Sat May 27 00:35:47 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (main): Remove dcl of and statements that set now-unused
	variable.

	* system.h [!STDC_HEADERS && HAVE_MEMORY_H]: Include memory.h.
	Without this, SunOS doesn't get type for memchr.
	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

Thu May 25 00:06:50 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (tail_lines): Change one more `long' to `off_t'.
	Otherwise, tail didn't work on NetBSD.  From Arne H. Juul.

	* csplit.c [struct control]: Change type of `repeat' to unsigned
	long to avoid conversion warning.

Sun May 21 07:50:00 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (.PHONY): TAGS is not a phony target.  From Franc,ois.

	* xstrtol.c (__strtol): Remove prototype altogether.

	per GNU Standards.

Thu May  4 23:15:58 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

Thu Apr 13 23:22:57 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* head.c: Remove block of redundant comments describing options.
	(usage): Remove reference to -l option.  It's not valid.

	* wc.c (wc): Don't overcount the number of bytes when reading
	from a regular file on stdin with file pointer not at BOF.
	From Karl Heuer <karl@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.  Before, the command
	`(dd ibs=99k skip=1; wc -c) < /etc/group' made wc wrongly output
	the size of the file.  Now it outputs `0'.

	not bcopy.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add strchr and strrchr.

Tue Jan 24 22:18:19 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fmt.c (copy_rest): Replace `||' with `&&'.  Before, a paragraph
	not followed by a newline would be followed by data copied from
	uninitialized storage.  Repeat by `printf abc|fmt|od -ac'.
	Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

	* od.c: Rename macros with FP_ prefix.  Use FLOAT_ instead.
	AIX-2.2.1 declares a typedef, FP_DOUBLE, that conflicted.
	Be careful to use off_t instead of explicit `unsigned long'.
	Otherwise, systems like 4.4BSD lose on calls to fseek that
	expect off_t (which is long long on that system).
	(parse_old_offset): Use xstrtoul
	(main): Likewise.

	* src/Makefile.in (od.o, tail.o): Depend on ../lib/strtol.h.

Mon Dec 19 22:13:55 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (numerous functions): Give char* filename arguments the

	(my_strtoul, uint_fatal_error): Remove functions.  Use xstrtoul
	and STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR instead.

Sun Dec 11 17:24:09 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* sort.c (main): Fix interpretation of field offsets when specified
	via -k option.  They were being interpreted as zero-indexed.  POSIX
	says they are 1-based indices.  From Rik Faith <faith@cs.unc.edu>.
	(keycompare): Don't ignore characters at the end of words when
	otherwise they would compare equal.  From Rik Faith.

	* tail.c (<most functions>): Change the type of n_units/n_lines/n_bytes
	to off_t because n_bytes is used as the option to fseek and off_t may
	be long long (e.g. on BSD4.4).  The only place where a 32-bit limit is
	imposed is in the string-to-integer converstion of xstrtol.
	(main): Use xstrtol instead of manual string to integer conversion.

	* csplit.c (get_format_width, get_format_prec): Use ISDIGIT instead of
	comparisons against '0' and '9'.

	* tr.c [!ULONGMAX]: Define it.

	* full-write.c: Declare (or not) errno based on definedness or
	errno, not STDC_HEADERS.
	* safe-read.c: Likewise.
	* xwrite.c: Likewise.

Thu Nov 17 06:37:33 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (dump_remainder): Flush standard output just before
	sleeping so that `tail -f' will output partial lines sooner.
	This applies only when following the end of a single file.
	From Leonard N. Zubkoff <lnz@dandelion.com>.

	* tail.c (file_lines, pipe_lines, pipe_bytes, start_bytes,
	start_lines, dump_remainder): Use STDOUT_FILENO instead of `1' in
	XWRITE calls.
	* tac.c (output): Use STDOUT_FILENO instead of `1' in xwrite call.
	* system.h (STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO): Define if

	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.
	Always include <config.h>.
	(main): Include program name in --version output.

Sun Nov 06 00:17:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* memcmp.c, srtoul.c: Use up-to-date versions.
	Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

	* src/Makefile.in (DEFS): Remove -Dlint... again.

	* src/Makefile.in (PROGS): Add fmt!
	Reported by Andreas Stolcke (stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU).

Fri Nov 04 17:26:16 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.10.

Thu Nov 03 23:23:08 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* linebuffer.h: Use __P instead of _P since the latter conflicts
	with a definition in some <ctype.h>.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

Wed Nov 02 17:36:34 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tr.c: Add const attribute where appropriate.

	* tail.c (BUFSIZ): Use definition from <stdio.h>.

Tue Nov 01 23:54:09 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tail.c (XWRITE): Allow n_bytes == 0 but call fwrite only if
	n_bytes is positive.  Turn off assertions.  `tail /dev/null' was
	getting a failed assertion.  Reported by Doug McLaren
	(dougmc@comco.com).

	* cut.c (cut_bytes): Print at least a newline for every line of input.
	(cut_fields): Print a newline even for lines whose only selected
	field is empty.  But print nothing when using -s without -f1.
	And print nothing for empty input.  Reported by
	Richard_Sharman@software.mitel.com.

Tue Nov 01 06:05:23 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

Mon Oct 31 06:53:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove memcmp since AC_FUNC_MEMCMP
	already handles it.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* {lib,src}/Makefile.in (DEFS): Don't use -Dlint.  Some systems
	get failures when it's defined.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* cat.c (cat): Conditionalize test for errno == ENOSYS.  It's not
	defined on some Next and Alliant systems.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* sort.c join.c (main): Include version.h and call parse_long_options
	with the proper number of arguments.  Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

Sun Oct 30 01:30:41 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* (configure.in): Add AC_OFF_T and rearrange by type along the

	sh-utils.

Tue Oct 04 20:42:46 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* od.c (my_strtoul): Set errno to zero before calling strtoul.
	Otherwise, od can fail complaining about a valid integer argument.
	From Andreas Schwab.

Sun Oct 02 17:57:09 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* tr.c (main): Give an error and fail when squeezing repeats
	and no non-options are given.  Reported by Tony Robinson
	(ajr@eng.cam.ac.uk).

	* sort.c (main): Temporarily copy each input file that might be
	another name for the output file.  When in doubt (e.g. a pipe),
	copy.  This allows the dangerous (historical -- in cnews) idiom
	`cat file | sort -o file' to work properly.  Don't rely on this
	behavior in new shell scripts.  From Paul Eggert (eggert@twinsun.com).

Mon Sep 26 18:01:47 1994  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* configure.in [AC_SIZEOF_TYPE]: Update for autoconf-1.9.
	* memchr.c: Test SIZEOF_LONG instead of LONG_64_BITS.

	of explicit echo commands.
	[INSTALL]: When AC_PROG_INSTALL resorts to setting this to

	script will be invoked only from subdirectories.
	[AC_SIZEOF_TYPE]: Use this instead of deprecated AC_LONG_64_BITS.

	* cat.c (cat): The command `:|cat -s' failed on Irix5 because
	ioctl (d, FIONREAD,... now returns ENOSYS for pipes -- under Irix4
	it returned EINVAL.  Detect this.
	(main) [lint]: Initialize variables to suppress `used before
	initialized' warnings.

	* csplit.c: Change long option name from --suffix to --suffix-format.

	* od.c (skip): Correct a comment.

Thu Jan 13 17:27:38 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in: Change all link commands to use both $(CFLAGS)
	and $(LDFLAGS).

	* csplit.c (load_buffer): Rather than incrementing buffer size,
	double it each time we fail to find a newline.  Otherwise, csplit

	* cut.c [ADD_RANGE_PAIR]: New macro.
	(set_fields): Collect the list of all selected ranges before
	allocating and initializing the boolean lookup table.

	Before, `sort -T/var/tmp' gave `sort: unrecognized option `-v''.
	Reported by Kristoffer Rose (kris@diku.dk).

	* cut.c (main): Give separate errors for `-s without -f'
	and `-d without -f'.
	(main): Now -d '' means `use the NUL byte as the delimiter'.

Mon Dec 20 23:29:30 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [test for 8-bit clean memcmp]: Add a test to detect
	losing memcmp from SunOS4.1.x.  From Robert H. de Vries
	<robert@and.nl>.

Sat Dec 18 01:12:24 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Put `touch stamp-config' in second arg
	so it goes in config.status.  This eliminates unnecessary second run
	of configure.

Thu Dec 02 23:53:03 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add isascii.
	* system.h [!defined (isascii) || defined (STDC_HEADERS)]: This failed
	on AIX PS/2 1.3 systems because isascii is a function and it is used
	in definitions (with the necessary side effect of assigning to a
	global variable) of the is* macros.  Also test HAVE_ISASCII and
	redefine ISASCII(c) instead of isascii.
	Reported by Minh Tran-Le (tranle@intellicorp.com).

Fri Nov 19 22:41:48 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	 * configure.in: Don't run the test for 8-bit clean memcmp if we
	 already know we'll be using our replacement.

Fri Nov 12 00:44:49 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.9.1.

	* tac.c (usage): Fix typo in long usage.
	* sort.c (usage): Likewise.
	From Philippe.Schnoebelen@imag.fr.

	* cut.c [FATAL_ERROR]: New macro.
	(main): Call both error and usage (2) through FATAL_ERROR in
	many places.  Before, only `error (2...' was called.
	(invalid_list): Removed.  This function is subsumed by FATAL_ERROR.

	* cut.c (cut_fields): Properly handle input lacking a terminating
	newline.  Before, the command  `printf "a\tb" |cut -f 1' generated
	no output.

Tue Nov 09 17:26:25 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	od.c (usage): Change --backward-compatible to --traditional in
	the long usage message.

Sat Nov 06 22:51:31 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cut.c (cut_fields): Revert July 27 change.  Instead, strip off
	trailing delimiter unless given a range of fields like `3-' that
	extends to end of line.
	(set_fields): Moved local `eol_range_start' to file-scope.
	Reported by Arne H. Juul (arnej@solan.unit.no).

Tue Nov 02 00:53:41 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fold.c (fold_file): Don't get stuck in an endless loop when
	width is smaller than 8 and there are TABs in the input.

	`--longopt=arg' syntax in --help message rather than `--longopt arg'.
	From Francois Pinard.

	* tail.c: Don't include <signal.h>.  It hasn't been necessary
	since the Dec 12, 1992 change.

	* join.c (main): Accept `-v 1' again.  Adding the --version
	long option had broken it, although -v1 still worked.  Call
	parse_long_options instead of adding "help" and "version"
	to join's longopt strct.
	* Makefile.in [SOURCES, OBJECTS, DISTFILES]: Add long-options.c
	and long-options.h.

Tue Oct 19 22:37:58 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* csplit.c: Allow repeat counts to be specified via `{*}'.
	New option --suffix=format.  Supercedes --digits option.
	New option --abandon-null-files.
	From Ronald F. Guilmette (rfg@netcom.com).

	* csplit.1: Updated.
	From Ronald F. Guilmette.

	* csplit.c: Remove register keyword (replace with `int' in two cases).

	* csplit.c: [MAX]: Macro renamed from max and moved to top of file.

	* src/*.c: Print version on standard output, not stderr.

	* configure.in: Add AC_LONG_64_BITS.
	* memchr.c: Use #ifdef LONG_64_BITS instead of
	`if (sizeof(longword) > 4)'.

Tue Jul 27 22:19:39 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cat.c (cat): Don't fail just because ioctl (d, FIONREAD,... can't
	always handle devices.  Ignore errno == EINVAL and errno == ENODEV.
	`cat -v /dev/null' was failing on many systems.

	* cut.c (cut_fields): Don't strip off trailing delimiter e.g.
	`echo 'a:b:c:' | cut -d: -f3-' should print `c:', not just `c'.
	From William Dowling <will@franklin.com>.

Thu May 27 01:37:51 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.8.

	* Version 1.7.

Sat May 22 02:13:12 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 1.6.

Fri May 21 22:57:53 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* pr.c (cols_ready_to_print): New function.  It replaces a global
	variable by the same name and computes on the fly the value that
	was supposed to be maintained through that variable.  This should
	put to rest the `pr -2a' bug.
	(main): Don't let getopt_long reorder arguments so we can
	distinguish between `pr -1 -2' and `pr -12'.  Rework handling of
	-n and +n options.

	* fold.c: Declare xmalloc.

Wed May 19 19:12:18 1993  Karl Berry  (karl@owl.hq.ileaf.com)

	* pr.c (print_page): Decrement cols_ready_to_print even when
	lines_to_print == 0.  The command `echo |pr -2ta' *still* didn't
	terminate.  Add parentheses for clarity.

Mon May  3 23:57:47 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* wc.c (write_counts): Ditto.

	* sum.1: Make documentation agree with the code.

	* od.c: Depend only on HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE for long double support.

	definition.  Remove unnecessary conjunct from test for hexadecimal
	prefix.

	* od.c: Depend on __GNUC__ || HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE rather than __STDC__
	for long double support;  there are compilers (Stardent Vistra svr4)

	* od.c (parse_old_offset): Allow `0X' as well as `0x' prefix to
	indicate hex.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Depend on Makefile so that changes to
	Makefile.in (like adding new files to DISTRIB) are reflected
	in the new distribution.

Fri Apr 23 21:53:47 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* {lib,src}/Makefile.in [.c.o]: Make CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS follow
	other options so users can use them to override DEFS.
	* src/Makefile.in [.c.o]: Add -I$(srcdir) for version.h.

	* Makefile.in [CFLAGS, LDFLAGS]: Don't set to -g explicitely;
	configure's AC_SUBST will set these.

	* Makefile.in [Makefile]: Add dependencies and a rule to remake it.
	[targets that cd then run make in subdirectories]: Don't depend
	on `cd ..';  use a subshell instead.

	the system's doesn't grok the 8th bit.
	* memcmp.c: Fix it so it groks the 8th bit.
	TODO: We really need to provide a fast memcmp, since most
	machines will have a broken memcmp.  Probably should get
	the one from glibc.
	* sort.c (mergefps): Maintain keybeg and keylim when copying
	the current line to `saved'.
	(numcompare): Skip white space here since -n no longer implies -b.
	(getmonth): Skip white space here since -M no longer implies -b.
	(compare): Completely overhauled to make the 8th bit work right,
	also to properly handle the global reverse option.
	(set_ordering): -n no longer implies -b, according to Posix.
	For consistency, -M also no longer implies -b.
	(main): Correct treatment of -r and global keys.
	(findlines): Clear keybeg and keylim if no keys are used.
	(sort): Avoid overwriting tempfiles[] array bounds.

	The command `echo |pr -2ta' didn't terminate.
	(print_page): Rewrite conditional (that had side effects in second
	conjunct) using nested if statements to make it clear that we do
	indeed want those semantics.
