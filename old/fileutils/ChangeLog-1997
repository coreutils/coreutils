	Remove incomplete, usage-like comment at top of file.

	* src/mv.c (do_move): If rename fails for any reason (not just when
	errno == EXDEV), then revert to trying copy-then-unlink.  This is

1997-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Don't require --force when target exists and

	(stringstruct): Remove typedef.

1997-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/savedir.c (savedir): Revert last change.  malloc always

	(jm_AC_HEADER_INTTYPES_H): Likewise.
	(jm_AC_TYPE_UINTMAX_T): Likewise.

	* lib/human.c (human_readable): Convert to ANSI-style definition.
	[lint]: Define `power'.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Rename inner-scoped `buf' arrays

	Clarify about powers of 1000 vs 1024.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libfu_a_SOURCES): Add new file human.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add new file human.h.

	* lib/fileblocks.c (st_blocks): long -> off_t.
	Avoid arithmetic overflow when size is near max.
	Depend on _POSIX_SOURCE and BSIZE, not _POSIX_VERSION, for
	compatibility with system.h.
	(BSIZE): Remove definition, since if BSIZE is not defined
	we're never invoked.

	* lib/fsusage.c: Do all calculations using uintmax_t.
	Include <inttypes.h> if available.
	(adjust_blocks, CONVERT_BLOCKS): Remove.
	(get_fs_usage): Set new member fsu_blocksize, and do not convert
	numbers to 512-byte block units; this avoids overflow here.
	Cast lseek arg to off_t, not long.

	* lib/fsusage.h (struct fs_usage): New member fsu_blocksize.
	Other members are now uintmax_t, not long.

	* lib/human.c, lib/human.h: New files.  The interface is inspired
	by the human_readable function that was in du.c, but it's pretty
	much rewritten from scratch.

	* lib/idcache.c (getuidbyname, getgidbyname): Names can now
	be NULL in cache.  This change merely fixes ifdeffed-out code.

	* lib/savedir.c (savedir): Check for size zero before invoking
	malloc; this can occur if st_size arg overflows on conversion to
	unsigned int.  All callers now cast st_size arg to unsigned int.

	* src/chgrp.c (<limits.h>, UINT_MAX, UINT_MAX): Remove; now
	done by system.h.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Store file size as off_t, not long.
	Do not assume st_size has been normalized to 512 byte blocks,
	or that it fits in size_t after dividing by the blocksize.

	* src/cp-hash.c (<inttypes.h>): Include if HAVE_INTTYPES_H.
	(hash_insert2): Cast inode number to uintmax_t; this prevents
	negative remainders if the inode number is negative and ino_t
	is longer than unsigned.

	* src/dd.c, src/df.c, src/du.c, src/ls.c (<inttypes.h>): Include if
	HAVE_INTTYPES_H.
	("human.h"): Include.

	* src/dd.c (input_blocksize, output_blocksize, conversion_blocksize):
	Now size_t instead of long.  0 means unset.

	(w_partial, w_full, r_partial, r_full, r_truncate):
	Now uintmax_t instead of unsigned.
	(print_stats): Print counts as uintmax_t, not unsigned.
	(main, skip): Check for overflow when computing file offsets.
	(skip): Records count arg is uintmax_t, not long; blocksize arg is
	size_t, not long.  Try lseek even on non regular files, as per comment.
	(oc, col): Now size_t, not int.
	(copy): No need to check max_records >= 0 any more, as the
	default value is now effectively infinity.
	Cast lseek arg to off_t.
	(copy, copy_with_block): conversion_blocksize - col can never
	be negative now, since it's unsigned, so rewrite loops to
	avoid problems with unsigned.
	(scanargs): Parse numeric args using uintmax_t, not int.
	Check for overflow when converting block size args to size_t.
	Blocksize options are now unsigned, and are now 0 when not set yet.
	(parse_integer): Return uintmax_t, not int; accept new int * arg
	to store error indicator, since all returned values are now valid.
	Check for overflow when scanning integer.

	* src/df.c (LONGEST_HUMAN_READABLE_1K_BYTE_BLOCKS): Remove.
	(human_readable_base): Renamed from human_blocks; value is now
	zero or positive integer, not just zero or nonzero.
	(output_units): New variable;
	replaces booleans kilobyte_blocks and megabyte_blocks.
	(long_options): Add --si or -H.
	(print_header): Adjust to renamed option variables.
	(human_readable_1k_blocks): Remove.
	(show_dev): Count blocks using uintmax_t, not long.
	Calculate percentages using double, not long; this still isn't
	perfect as it suffers double rounding, but it's more likely to
	round correctly in practice than using long did.
	Adjust to renamed option variables.
	Use new human_readable library function to format uintmax_t values.
	(usage): Add -H, --si.
	(main): Adjust to renamed option variables.
	Use -H if BLOCKSIZE is SI.  Add -H.

	* src/du.c (LONGEST_HUMAN_READABLE, enum Output_units): Remove.
	(count_entry): Now returns uintmax_t, not long.
	(human_readable_base): Renamed from opt_human_readable; value is now
	zero or positive integer, not just zero or nonzero.
	(output_units): Now an integer giving output size.
	(tot_size): Now uintmax_t, not long.
	(long_options, usage): Add --si or -H.
	(main): Adjust to renamed option variables.
	Use -H if BLOCKSIZE is SI.  Add -H.
	(human_readable): Remove; rewritten and now in lib/human.c.
	(print_size): Rewrite in terms of human_readable.
	Accept extra arg to be printed after size; all callers changed.

	* src/install.c (BITSPERBYTE): Remove.
	(UID_T_MAX, GID_T_MAX): Define in terms of TYPE_MAXIMUM.

	* src/ls.c (<limits.h>): Don't include; system.h does it now.
	(INT_MAX): Remove.
	(longdiff): Remove bogus definition that uses subtraction;
	it gives the wrong answer when overflows occur.
	(convert_blocks): Remove.
	(output_units): New variable;
	replaces booleans kilobyte_blocks and megabyte_blocks.
	(human_readable_base): New variable.
	(long_options, usage): Add -h or --human-readable and -H or --si.
	(decode_switches): Adjust to renamed option variables.
	Use -H if BLOCKSIZE is SI.  Add -h, -H.
	(print_dir): Count blocks using uintmax_t, not int.
	(gobble_file): Now returns uintmax_t, not int.
	Don't convert blocks to 512 byte units, as this might overflow;
	let caller handle the problem.  Deduce what caller will print
	by invoking human_readable.
	(print_long_format, print_file_name_and_frills): Don't assume
	inode number, block count, file size fit in unsigned long.
	Use human_readable to do block count conversion and to print
	file sizes.
	(prep_non_filename_text): Print decimal string for time if
	localtime fails due to enormous time_t.

	* src/system.h (<limits.h>): Include if HAVE_LIMITS_H.
	(CHAR_BIT, TYPE_SIGNED, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_MAXIMUM, INT_MAX, UINT_MAX):

	parse it.

	* lib/strdup.c [HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Include config.h.

	* src/rm.c: Finish rewrite to use chdir and hash tables.
	See `Implementation overview' comment in the source.

1997-09-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/install.c: Add new option: --verbose (-v).
	From Andreas Schwab.

1997-09-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/chgrp.c (change_file_group): Call describe_change with a
	3-state argument.
	(describe_change): Report whether the operation was successful,
	a failure, or that the request was a no-op.
	Before, running `chgrp --verb bin /' as non-root reported

	3-state argument.
	(describe_change): Report whether the operation was successful,
	a failure, or that the request was a no-op.

	From Andreas Schwab.

1997-07-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/mv.c (apply_attributes): New function.
	(copy_reg): Use apply_attributes instead of open-coding the pieces.
	Now, failure to preserve file attributes does not cause mv to change
	its exit status, and such failures elicit warning diagnostics.  This
	behavior is required by POSIX.  Before, failure to preserve ownership
	due to insufficient access was diagnosed only for root.
	Prompted by a report from Bengt Martensson.

Tue Jul  1 06:42:17 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Reorder stat-then-mkdir-if-missing
	calls so that mkdir is called first.  Before make_path would first
	`stat' a directory, then call mkdir if it didn't exist.  But if
	some other process created the directory between the stat & mkdir,
	the mkdir would fail with EEXIST.  Diagnosis and suggestion from
	Greg McGary.

Sun Jun 29 17:19:30 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/dd.c (copy): Add FIXME comment.

	* src/ls.c: (init_col_info): New function.
	(print_current_files): Call init_col_info if format is
	`many_per_line' or `horizontal'.
	(print_many_per_line): Calculate and apply optimum column widths.
	(print_horizontal): Likewise.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

	* src/mv.c (movefile): Take new boolean parameter, DEST_IS_DIR,
	to save a stat per moved file when the destination is a directory.
	(main): Call movefile with additional argument.
	(strip_trailing_slashes_2): New function.
	(movefile): Remove trailing slashes from dest.  Otherwise, stat ("b/")
	fails with ENOTDIR on systems including Linux w/libc 2.0.30.
	Reproduce with `rm -rf a b; mkdir a; touch b; ./mv a b/'.
	(do_move): Fix misleading comment.

Sat Jun 21 21:26:57 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/full-write.c (full_write): Add comment regarding failure due
	to bug in Linux Slackware 1.2.13 kernel.

	* lib/makepath.c: Rewrite using save-cwd.c and chdir to remove
	quadratic component of complexity.  Before, it processed O(n^2)
	directory name components via stat and mkdir.  Now it's O(n).
	This makes mkdir -p a lot more efficient when creating directories
	with very many components.  On a Linux 2.0.30 ext2fs filesystem
	this command: mkdir -p `perl -e 'print "a/" x 500'`  now runs in
	0.77 seconds (user+sys).  Contrast that with the 9.5(!) seconds
	it took before.

Sat Jun 14 11:40:17 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* man/Makefile.am: (EXTRA_DIST): Put man_MANS here so they are
	distributed.  This is necessary for automake-1.1p.

Tue Jun  3 15:00:00 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/fileblocks.c [HAVE_UNISTD_H]: Include unistd.h.
	John Gatewood Ham reported that this is necessary for DJGPP/Win95.

Wed May 28 06:35:56 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/mountlist.c (read_filesystem_list): Add `|| defined (__OpenBSD__)'
	to the NetBSD #if so OpenBSD also uses the f_fstypename member.
	(fstype_to_string): Add `&& !defined (__OpenBSD__)' to the NetBSD #if
	expression to exclude this function definition.  OpenBSD 2.1 beta
	doesn't need it.  Patch from Hugh Daniel <hugh@ecotone.xanadu.com>

Tue May 27 04:35:17 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	Don't replace basename.  Now we use only base_name.
	Clean up kludge that worked around a bug (now-fixed) in automake.

	* lib/argmatch.h Change dcl of program_name so it doesn't conflict
	with the ubiquitous char* one.

	* lib/addext.c: New file.
	* lib/Makefile.am (libfu_a_SOURCES): Add addext.c.
	Remove getversion.c;  get_version is now in backupfile.c.

Sun May 25 09:21:01 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): When preserving symlinks
	(--no-dereference) and the destination file is a symlink,
	use stat (not xstat) to see if it points back to the source.
	Reported by James <james@albion.glarp.com>.

	* src/du.c: Remove global variable opt_human_readable.
	(enum Output_units): Rename from output_size.
	Rename size_* to Unit_*.

	512-byte blocks, not bytes.
	(print_size): New function.
	(du_files): Use print_size instead of open coding it.
	(count_entry): Always count in units of 512-byte blocks to delay.
	This lets du accumulate totals corresponding to a terabyte before
	overflowing 32-bit long int.
	Use print_size instead of open coding it.

	Tue Feb  4 11:58:49 1997  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

	* src/du.c (convert_blocks): Remove now-unnecessary #undef.
	(du_files): Pass output_size unchanged to convert_blocks.  No need
	to test output_size for size_bytes, convert_blocks handles that
	correctly.
	(count_entry): Likewise.

	* src/system.h (convert_blocks): Remove definition.
	* src/ls.c (convert_blocks): Add definition.

Sun May 25 09:11:17 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Ignore value of COLUMNS envionment
	variable when it is the empty string.  Suggestion from Ulrich Drepper.
	This makes it easier on people using shells (which?) with which it
	is not easy to unset environment variables.

Wed Feb 26 23:46:39 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/getdate.y: (tYEAR_UNIT): Increase yyRelYear by $1, not just by 1.

	(usage): Bracket bug-reporting address with <> and append a period.

1997-01-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Fix off-by-one problem in size
	being passed to strftime.

	* Version 3.16.

	* acconfig.h (strftime): Add #undef.  From Marcus Daniels.

Sat Jan 25 00:34:39 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/du.c (count_entry): Fix blatant bug (typo?) that made
	--megabytes report numbers in units of kilobytes.
	Reported by Galen Hazelwood.

	* src/cp.h: Remove now-unnecessary prototype for is_ancestor.

	* lib/Makefile.am (noinst_HEADERS): Add getdate.h.

	* src/cp-aux.c (is_ancestor): Remove function.
	* src/cp.c (is_ancestor): Add function.

	* src/cp.h: Remove spurious extern dcl of htab.

	* m4/getgroups.m4: Move the code from configure.in into
	this macro that resorts to looking for getgroups in -lbsd.
	Set new shell variable, GETGROUPS_LIB (that callers should check),
	if it is found there.
	* configure.in: Check $GETGROUPS_LIB just after jm_FUNC_GETGROUPS.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove getgroups.
	Remove code that resorts to looking for getgroups in -lbsd.

	* configure.in (jm_FUNC_GNU_STRFTIME): Use it -- because ls
	needs a version of strftime that supports the %e format and
	pretty many systems lack that: NextStep 3.3, Mips Ultrix ?.?.
	This is a little bit overkill (for now) in that if the strftime
	in your C library doesn't have all features of GNU strftime (even
	though it may support %e) ls will be linked with the version of
	strftime provided with this package.  But for an upcoming release,
	GNU ls will provide an option to allow the user to specify the
	date format string -- and for that I want to make GNU strftime
	the default in any case.  Think of this as an incentive to use
	the GNU C library.

Fri Jan 24 23:36:00 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/long-options.c (parse_long_options): Reset optind to zero
	before just returning so that getopt internals get initialized from
	the probably-new parameters when/if getopt is called later.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

Mon Jan 20 06:52:09 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* configure.in (fu_cv_sys_truncating_statfs): Add preprocessor
	guard to make sure that this test for Sun brokenness doesn't
	get a false positive on any other type of system.  Eirik Fuller
	reported that Linux 2.1.20 <sys/vfs.h> has a f_spare member in
	the statfs struct.  And that triggered a false positive.

Thu Jan  9 06:23:18 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* m4/gettext.m4: Remove AC_ISC_POSIX.  From Karl Heuer.

Wed Jan  8 16:38:24 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Version 3.15.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Cast alloca return value to char*.

	* lib/getopt.c (_getopt_internal): Use `_', rather than the
	(sometimes-)expansion `gettext'.

Tue Jan  7 22:49:55 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/getopt.c: New (more POSIX compliant) version from GNU libc.
	[_]: Define to gettext also if ENABLE_NLS is defined.
	This is temporary.

Sun Jan  5 09:33:07 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Avoid making unnecessary copy of
	date/time string.  Patch from Paul Eggert.
	(print_long_format): NUL-terminate line of output.
	(print_long_format): Detect and handle strftime failure
	due to pathologically long strings in locale tables.
	Patch from Paul Eggert.
	(print_long_format): Change references to BIGBUF in use of
	FPUTS macro to references to BUF.
	Use 11 (not 20) bytes for mode string buffer.

Sat Jan  4 21:14:36 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Clean up vestiges of legacy
	ctime-oriented code.  With internationalization and strftime,
	you can't presume that %a expands to a 3-byte string.
	Reported by Ross Ridge.
	(print_long_format): Use POSIX-mandated %e (blank-padded numeric
	day of month), not %d (the same number, but *zero*-filled).

Fri Jan  3 21:08:29 1997  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* acconfig.h (getgroups): Add #undef.
	From Marcus Daniels.

	* lib/getgroups.c: New file.

	* configure.in (AC_ARG_PROGRAM): Remove explicit use.
	It's implicit in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE.  From Wayne Stewart.
	(list_mounted_fs): Fix typo (by declaring NUMSYS) in test for
	getfsstat on osf1.  From hitchens@epa001.enet.dec.com.

Sun Dec 29 21:55:13 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* configure.in (jm_FUNC_GETGROUPS): Use it.

Sat Dec 28 14:32:05 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ls.c: Two problems fixed by these changes from Joakim Rosqvist.
	Quoting Joakim:
	1) The "total" number and the size of the first file as
	output from 'ls --color -s' did not get colorized according
	to the "no"-argument in LS_COLORS. Fixed by adding a function
	prep_non_filename_text which prints the C_LEFT C_NORM C_RIGHT
	strings (or C_END). It is called from main before any text is
	output, and from print_name_with_quoting after having output a
	colorized filename.
	2) If the "no"-argument of LS_COLORS is set, the terminal will be
	set to print in that color after ls exits. The man-pages suggests
	setting "no" and "fi" to the terminals default colors to avoid
	the problem, but that would mean I can't use anything but the
	default color for regular files and non-filename text. Fixed by
	outputting C_LEFT immediately followed by C_RIGHT right before
	exit, which restores the default color.

Fri Dec 27 17:29:02 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (aclocal.m4): No longer depend on acinclude.m4.

Sun Dec 22 23:29:10 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* acinclude.m4: Move macros to individual files in new directory, m4/.
	See ChangeLog entries in sh-utils for the details.

Wed Dec 18 23:09:19 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/dircolors.hin (ORPHAN): By default, color orphans red on
	a black background.

	* src/dircolors.c (usage): Remove --print-data-base.
	Now only --print-database remains.  Although it wasn't documented,
	--print-data-base was still accepted.  But it made `--p', `--print',
	`--print-data', etc. ambiguous.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Stat symlinks also when printing with
	color and set linkok to reflect existence of referent.
	Patches from Joakim Rosqvist, James Antill, and Jesse Thilo.

Tue Dec 17 21:03:40 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	used to have.  From Paul Eggert.
	* lib/backupfile.c (ISDIGIT): Likewise.
	* lib/getdate.y (ISDIGIT): Likewise.

	* src/cp.c (ROOT_CHOWN_AFFECTS_SYMLINKS): New macro.
	(DO_CHOWN): Take an additional parameter.
	(LINK_CHOWN): Remove macro.
	(copy): When preserving owner and group of a symlink, use
	chown only if ROOT_CHOWN_AFFECTS_SYMLINKS and EUID == 0.
	Otherwise, the chown would affect the file referenced through
	the symlink.

Sat Dec 14 14:51:50 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* acinclude.m4 (jm_SYS_PROC_UPTIME): Fix typo in cache variable
	name for cross compiling.
	Remove definitions of gettext-related macros.  The gettext
	installation procedure installs corresponding .m4 files so that
	aclocal will use them.

Wed Dec 11 19:34:22 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Version 3.14.

Tue Dec 10 00:14:24 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 3.13k.

	* src/install.c [_POSIX_VERSION]: Don't declare wait.  That
	declaration conflicted with one in a system header file on
	i386-pc-isc3.0, now that I've removed the AC_ISC_POSIX macro
	and _POSIX_VERSION is no longer defined.
	Reported by Karl Heuer.

	* configure.in (AC_ISC_POSIX): Remove kludgy macro.
	Use this test instead:
	(LIBS): Add -lcposix if it contains strerror.
	Patch from Karl Heuer.

	* lib/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add mktime.c.
	Reported by Thomas Bushnell.
	* (EXTRA_DIST): Add strftime.c to appease automake.
	Although it's not used yet, it'll be used by ls's (to-be-done)
	--format=FORMAT option.

Mon Dec  9 18:26:54 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/obstack.h: Include config.h.
	[!HAVE_BCOPY && HAVE_MEMCPY && !defined (bcopy)]: Define bcopy
	in terms of memcpy.  Reported by Marcus Daniels.

	* configure.in (LIBOBJS): After AC_FUNC_FNMATCH, add fnmatch.o
	and define fnmatch to rpl_fnmatch if necessary.

	* acconfig.h (fnmatch): Add undef.

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Convert from K&R style header to ANSI.
	Patch from Kaveh Ghazi.

Sun Dec  8 07:22:38 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	=========== Update for automake-1.1k.
	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require 1.1k.
	* configure.in (AM_CONFIG_HEADER): Use it.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Remove stamp-h timestamping statement.
	Now, AM_CONFIG_HEADER does it automatically.
	* lib/Makefile.am (noinst_LIBRARIES): Rename to libfu.a as per
	new automake requirement.
	Rename fu_* variables to libfu_a_*.

Mon Dec  2 20:30:20 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/system.h [!S_IXUGO] (S_IXUGO): Define it.

	* src/ls.c (print_color_indicator): Check the file's suffix only
	if it's a regular file.
	Reported by Santiago Vila Doncel.
	(print_type_indicator): Use S_IXUGO instead of writing out
	(S_IEXEC | S_IXGRP | S_IXOTH).
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Likewise.

Sun Dec  1 13:07:39 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/getdate.y (date): Interpret the date, L/M/N, as YYYY/MM/DD
	if L >= 1000, otherwise as MM/DD/YY.  With this change,
	date --date=DATE accepts dates like those in an RCS log listing.

Sat Nov 30 22:11:42 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* acinclude.m4: (jm_FUNC_MKTIME): New macro.  This is like
	AM_FUNC_MKTIME, but with one addition: when it replaces the
	function, it also redefines mktime to gnu_mktime.

Fri Nov 29 21:19:13 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/install.c (copy_file): Allow installation from non-directory
	(rather than only regular) files.  Suggestion from Charles Karney.

	with Solaris.  From Peter Eriksson.

	* src/ls.c (main): Close stdout and check result, in case any
	deferred writes fail.
	Use EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE in exit and usage calls.

Thu Nov 28 13:10:22 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Use strip_trailing_slashes and dirname
	instead of open-coding them.  When given FILE containing no slashes,
	chdir to the directory containing it (the current directory) rather
	than to `..'.

	Tue Nov  5 14:51:56 1996  Miles Bader  <miles@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* src/df.c (find_mount_point): Use save_cwd/restore_cwd.

	Wed Oct 30 00:21:16 1996  Miles Bader  <miles@gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* lib/fsusage.c (get_fs_usage): If DISK is 0 and we needed to use
	it, return -1 with 0 in ERRNO.
	* src/df.c (show_dev): Deal with null values for DISK and FSTYPE,
	including interpreting special 0 errno return from get_fs_usage.
	(show_point): Don't fail if we can't find a mount entry for POINT,
	just call show_dev with 0 values and let it fail if necessary.

	* src/cp.c (copy): With -i and not -f, prompt for any type of
	(non-directory) source file before overwriting an existing target.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Add Spanish (es).

	* doc/Makefile.am (MAKEINFO): Set to makeinfo --no-split.
	Otherwise, the generated info files have names longer than
	the 14-byte max of some old systems.
	Reported by Karl Heuer.

Tue Oct 29 06:49:16 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Make -A set really_all_files to zero
	as well as setting all_files to 1.  With this change, ls -f -A prints
	everything but . and .., unsorted.  Before, the -A was effectively
	ignored.  From Karl Berry.

Tue Oct 22 07:00:00 1996  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am (dircolors.h): Depend on dcgen only in maintainer

	* cp.c: Include assert.h (disabled).
	(path_concat): New function.
	(do_copy): Use path_concat instead of open-coding part of its

Thu Oct  5 21:49:34 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF): Add new test.  Testing for
	the existence of <utime.h> is insufficient on some Next systems.
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_STRUCT_UTIMBUF): Add it.
	* system.h [!HAVE_UTIME_H]: Don't declare struct utimbuf here.

	* chgrp.c: Include limits.h.
	[!INT_MAX]: Define it.

	* df.c (show_point): Cast -2 to dev_t before assignment.

	* acconfig.h (STATFS_TRUNCATES_BLOCK_COUNTS): Add it.
	* configure.in (STATFS_TRUNCATES_BLOCK_COUNTS): New check to enable
	workaround for SunOS statfs brokenness.  Block counts in struct
	statfs for partitions 2GB and larger are truncated, but correct
	values are stored in f_spare array member.

	* fsusage.c (get_fs_usage) [STATFS_TRUNCATES_BLOCK_COUNTS]: Copy
	untruncated block counts from f_spare array into proper members
	of struct statfs. From Eirik Fuller (eirik@netapp.com);

	* ls.c (dired_dump_obstack): Don't generate any output if the
	obstack is empty.
	(main): Always initialize and dump subdired_obstack, not just if -R.
	`ls -lDR dir dir2' was using uninitialized subdired_obstack.
	Reported by Samuli K{rkk{inen <hskarkka@snakemail.hut.fi>.

Tue Sep 26 23:05:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in (install-data, uninstall): Use sed not basename.
	The GNU Coding Standard suggests that only a select set of
	relatively standard utilities be used in Makefiles.  basename is
	not among them.  Suggested by Ulrich Drepper.

Mon Sep 25 23:12:37 1995  Jim Meyering  <meyering@gremlin.comco.com>

	* src/df.c (show_point): Ignore mtab entries with either
	nonexistent mount points or with inconsistent device number.

	From Franc,ois.

Fri Aug  4 22:11:06 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* install.c (isnumber): Rename to is_number to avoid conflict with
	FreeBSD 2.0.5 macro definition.  Reported by David O'Brien
	(obrien@sea.legent.com).

	* lib/save-cwd.c: New file.
	* lib/save-cwd.h: New file.
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS, DISTFILES): Update for new files.

	* configure.in: (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Remove fnmatch.
	Add check for working fnmatch functions so that
	systems providing it don't incur the space overhead of linking
	with the version in lib.  Cross compiling builds always use the
	version in lib.

	* ls.c (decode_switches): Set SORT_TYPE.  Before, ls -c was sorting
	by name, rather than change time.  Reported by Ken Estes
	(m-ke0082@sparky.cs.nyu.edu).

	* du.c: (save_cwd, restore_cwd, free_cwd): Remove functions.
	New versions have been broken out into save-cwd.c.

	* xstrtoul.c, xstrtoul.h: New files.
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS, DISTFILES): Update for new files.

	* chgrp.c (parse_group): Use xstrtoul instead of isnumber; the
	latter would silently overflow, accepting a group id larger
	than INT_MAX.
	(isnumber): Remove now-unused static function.
	(change_file_group) [MAXUID]: Give a more descriptive message
	when numeric group id is larger than MAXUID.

Sat May 27 00:35:47 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h [!STDC_HEADERS && HAVE_MEMORY_H]: Include memory.h.
	Without this, SunOS doesn't get type for memchr.
	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

Sun May 21 07:20:55 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* all source files (usage): Include one- or two-line synopsis
	in --help output.  From Karl Berry.

	Update definitions for ISDIGIT.

	* basename.c (basename): Make argument const.

	* euidaccess.c (eaccess_stat): Make statp and path arguments const.
	(euidaccess): Make statp argument const.  Use stat, not safe_stat.

	* fsusage.c (statfs): Use stat, not safe_stat.
	* isdir.c (isdir): Likewise.
	* mkdir.c (mkdir): Likewise.
	* rename.c (rename): Likewise.
	* rmdir.c (rmdir): Likewise.

	* userspec.c (parse_user_spec): Use strchr, not index.
	[!HAVE_STRING_H]: Define strchr in terms of index, not the
	other way around.

	* makepath.c: (make_path): Use stat, not SAFE_STAT.

	* mv.c (movefile): Remove a single trailing slash from destdir
	before concatenating with `/' and filename for `ok to overwrite...'
	message.  Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

Mon May  1 23:03:30 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.c (quote_filename): Never return NULL when quoting filenames
	as C-strings.  --quote-name was quoting only strings containing
	at least one C-quotable character.  Reported by David J. MacKenzie.

Mon Mar 20 21:44:40 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* rename.c (rename): Compare src and dest inode numbers rather
	than src inode and dest dev when determining whether they refer
	to the same file.  From marc@math.cornell.edu (Marc Parmet).

	* df.c (usage): Add ellipsis after `[OPTION]'.  Use FILE,
	not deprecated PATH in text of help message.  From Karl Berry.

	* src/*.c: Update Copyright dates.

	* src/Makefile.in (uninstall): Handle case in which LIBPROGS is empty.
	Reported by Peter Smidt <smidt@cd.chalmers.se>.

Mon Feb 20 22:54:39 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* du.c (save_cwd, restore_cwd): New functions.
	(main): Use them instead of open coded versions.
	(count_entry): Use them here instead of relying on chdir ("..") --
	but only when necessary.  Before, with --dereference (-L),
	traversing a symlink caused failure because chdir ("..") didn't
	work as expected.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

Sat Feb 11 07:52:01 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add memcmp, memcpy, and memset.

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, cp-hash.c, cp.c, df.c, du.c, install.c,
	ln.c, ls.c, mv.c, mvdir.c, rm.c, touch.c: Rename SAFE_STAT and
	SAFE_LSTAT to safe_stat and safe_lstat.

	* basename.c (basename): Use strrchr, not rindex.

Tue Dec 27 07:07:53 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/*.c: Include "error.h" rather than simply declaring
	`void error ();'.
	* src/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Depend on ../lib/error.h.

	* sync.c (main): Make error message accurate.

	* dd.c (skip): Use safe_read instead of read.

	From Bruno Haible.

Sat Dec 10 00:02:09 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Makefile.in (install): Install `install' first as transformed
	`ginstall,' then remove the target (transformed `install')
	and move GNU install into its place.  Before, the installation
	process failed on systems (e.g. HPUX) that can't overwrite the
	executable associated with a running process.

	* system.h [!HAVE_STRING_H]: Define strchr to index and strrchr to
	rindex instead of the other way around.
	* rmdir.c (remove_parents): Use strr?chr instead of r?index.
	* mvdir.c (main): Likewise.

	[isascii, ISDIGIT]: Remove definitions.
	* chgrp.c: Likewise.
	* dd.c: Likewise.

Sun Dec  4 14:53:12 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* doc/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add getdate.texi.

Fri Nov 11 11:15:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* mknod.c (my_strtol): New function.
	(main): Use it instead of atoi to convert argument strings to
	major and minor device numbers.  Now, mknod diagnoses invalid
	device numbers and accepts octal and hexadecimal as well as
	decimal string arguments.  Ralf Lammers
	<rlammers@physik.uni-osnabrueck.de> suggested that mknod accept
	hex device numbers for compatibility with HPUX's mknod program.

	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add strtol.
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES): Add strtol.c.

Sun Nov 06 00:18:56 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 3.12.

Sat Nov 05 15:20:07 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* makepath.c (makepath) [__STDC__]: Add an ANSI-style prototype.
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

Fri Nov 04 17:27:55 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 3.10.

Thu Nov 03 12:59:34 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* makepath.h: New file.
	* makepath.c: Include it.
	Add an argument: PRESERVE_EXISTING.
	Declare char* arguments const.
	* install.c, mkdir.c: Update callers.  Set it in mkdir.c so
	that `mkdir -p' ignores existing directories as POSIX mandates.
	Before, it would try to change owner and/or permissions of such
	directories.  Christopher S. Arthur <csa@halcyon.com> reported
	the mkdir -p failure.
	* lib/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add it.
	(makepath.o): Depend on makepath.h.
	* src/Makefile.in (install.o, mkdir.o): Depend on makepath.h.
	* cp.c (make_path_private): Rename function from make_path to
	avoid confusion.
	(do_copy): Update caller.

	* ls.c: Include <limits.h> before system.h because limits.h on
	some systems undefines PATH_MAX, whereas system.h includes pathmax.h
	which sets PATH_MAX.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* euidaccess.c: Define S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, and S_IXOTH in terms of
	S_IEXEC if they're not already defined.  Reported by Kaveh Ghazi
	and Daniel Hagerty <hag@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

Tue Nov 01 06:18:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* eaccess.c (euidaccess): Rename from eaccess to avoid conflict
	with like-named, different function in some C libraries.
	* euidaccess.c: Renamed from eaccess.c
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES): Rename eaccess.c.
	Update dependency, too.
	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Check for euidaccess

Mon Oct 31 08:02:31 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.c (dired_dump_obstack): Cast obstack_finish for non-ANSI
	compilers.  Kaveh Ghazi reported the problem.

Sat Oct 29 00:42:18 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fsusage.c (get_fs_usage) [STAT_STATFS4]: Define CONVERT_BLOCKS
	to adjust_blocks for _AIX.  Was getting off-by-8x numbers.

	* df.c: Make --sync the default.
	Add new option: --no-sync.
	Remove short option alias for --sync.
	(usage): Update.

	* ls.c [!STDC_HEADERS]: Declare free.
	(dired_dump_obstack): Cast pos[i] (of type size_t) to int so it
	matches %d in printf.
	(quote_filename): Fix typo in stpcpy call.

Thu Oct 27 00:02:45 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fsusage.c: Include <sys/stat.h> before safe-stat.h.

	* cp.c (make_path): Don't change protections on existing directory.
	Reported by Andreas Schwab.

	* df.c: New option: --sync.  No longer perform sync by default.
	Do it only when this option is used.  Invoking sync can be very
	expensive, and it's not clear that doing so yields more up to date
	results.  With encouragement/prodding from Paolo Zeppegno
	(paolo@to.sem.it), Nick Holloway, and Kaveh Ghazi.

Thu Oct 20 00:52:59 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h [!S_IEXEC]: Define as S_IXUSR.

	* cp.h [S_IEXEC]: Remove definition.  cp.c doesn't use it.

	* ls.c [!INT_MAX]: Define to 2^31 - 1 so subsequent #if test works.
	[S_IEXEC]: Remove definition.  It's in system.h now.
	(usage): Sort options, but without segregating upper and lower case.

	* ls.c: Support for new option: --dired (-D).
	(dired, dired_pos, dired_obstack, subdired_obstack): Global variables.
	[PUTCHAR, FPUTS, FPUTS_LITERAL, PUSH_CURRENT_DIRED_POS]: New macros
	(dired_dump_obstack, quote_filename): New functions.
	(main): Initialize obstacks.
	(decode_switches): Recognize -D.
	(print_dir): Make arguments `const.'
	Record directory name indices in obstack.
	(print_dir, print_long_format, print_type_indicator): Use macros
	FPUTS, FPUTS_LITERAL, PUTCHAR for output.
	(print_long_format): Record file name indices in obstack.
	(print_name_with_quoting): Just call quote_filename and output the
	result.

Mon Oct 17 23:56:36 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* savedir.c: Indent CPP conditionals.  Change some #ifdefs to #ifs.
	From Franc,ois Pinard.

Mon Oct 17 10:27:26 1994  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@duality.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* lib/dirname.c: Use strrchr, not rindex.

Sun Oct 16 07:53:27 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h (S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, S_IXOTH): Define these in terms of
	S_IEXEC if they're not already defined. From Kaveh Ghazi.

	* eaccess.c (eaccess_stat): Don't use NULL in comparison.
	Some systems don't define it except in stdio.h -- and including
	(yes, just including) stdio.h has been known to significantly
	increase object code size (though admittedly, that probably
	happens only on old systems).  Kaveh Ghazi reported the problem.

	* src/Makfile.in lib/Makfile.in (DEFS): Remove -Dlint.
	It causes problems on broken pyramid system.
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

Sat Oct 08 10:39:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* mountlist.c: Always include <sys/param.h> if it exists.
	(fstype_to_string) [__NetBSD__]: Don't define this function.
	(read_filesystem_list) [__NetBSD__]: Use fsp's f_fstypename field,
	rather than fstype_to_string (f_type).  With suggestions from
	Greg Hudson (ghudson@mit.edu).

	* lib/Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Remove eaccess.o.
	* configure.in (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add `eaccess' here instead.
	The Hurd and Linux will have it.

Fri Oct 07 20:27:48 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* (doc): New subdirectory with texinfo documentation.
	* fileutils.texi: Thanks to Franc,ois Pinard and Karl Berry!

	* Makefile.in (All of them): Update from the ones in sh-utils.
	From now on, rules and definitions that are comon to the fileutils,
	textutils, and sh-utils will get ChangeLog entries only in the
	sh-utils.

	* Makefile.in (install, uninstall): Prepend ginstall->install
	mapping to standard $(transform) sed mapping.

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, install.c, mkdir.c, mkfifo.c, mknod.c,
	rm.c, rmdir.c (main): Diagnose wrong number of argument -- usually
	too few -- instead of just referring the user to the --help option.
	* mknod.c (main): Give diagnostics explaining specific problems
	instead of just the usage message.  Reported by Karl Berry.

	* configure.in: Overhaul tests that determine how to get filesystem
	usage statistics.  Now, most use AC_TRY_RUN and test for the precise
	feature that will be used.  I know that that will make configuring a
	little harder for the people who cross compile, but if one of them
	is annoyed enough (or complains loudly enough :-) maybe someone will
	find the time to add tests to be used solely when cross compiling.
	* acconfig.h (STAT_READ): Rename to STAT_READ_FILSYS.
	* fsusage.c: Reorganize accordingly.

Tue Oct 04 20:38:12 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* chmod.c (main): Remove trailing slashes from file name arguments.
	Otherwise, `chmod 600 foo/; chmod 700 foo/' failed with the error
	`chmod: foo/: Permission denied' under Linux 1.1.51.  Reported by
	Thomas Koenig (ig25@fg70.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de).
	* chown.c (main): Likewise.

Thu Oct  2 23:03:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Replace obsolete AC_DIR_HEADER with AC_HEADER_DIRENT
	and AC_FUNC_CLOSEDIR_VOID.

	* configure.in: Remove AC_SIZEOF_TYPE(int).
	ls.c: Instead of comparing SIZEOF_INT == 2, compare INT_MAX to 2^16.
	Suggestion from Roland McGrath.

Sat Oct 01 21:23:27 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/*.c: Remove CONFIG_BROKETS conditional.

	* {*/,}Makefile.in: Revamp to look much like those in sh-utils.
	* acconfig.h (HAVE_FTRUNCATE): Remove it.
	(ino_t, D_INO_IN_DIRENT): Add these.

	* configure.in: Convert for autoconf-2.0.
	* backupfile.c: Likewise.
	* savedir.c: Likewise.

	* mkdir.c, rmdir.c: Split the two functions from old mkdir.c into
	separate files.

	* chgrp.c [_POSIX_VERSION]: Test this instead of _POSIX_SOURCE.

	* ls.c: Don't use SIZEOF_INT because it would require configure
	to run a program -- then cross compilers would lose.  Instead,
	compare INT_MAX to 64k-1 since all we need to know is whether
	an int is 2 bytes or larger.

	* rm.c [D_INO]: Use D_INO_IN_DIRENT rather than _POSIX_SOURCE in the
	test for how to define this macro.

	* system.h: Use HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H (not _POSIX_SOURCE) in test
	for whether to include <sys/param.h>.
	Likewise for <utime.h>.
	Update for DIRENT->HAVE_DIRENT_H etc. autoconf-2.0 changes.
	Ditto for VOID_CLOSEDIR->CLOSEDIR_VOID.

	* xgetcwd.c [!_POSIX_VERSION && !HAVE_GETCWD]: Remove
	!defined (_POSIX_VERSION) conjunct.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

Mon Sep 26 17:47:17 1994  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* lib/*.c: Remove CONFIG_BROKETS conditional.
	* lib/Makefile.in src/Makefile.in: Don't define it.

Sun Sep 25 12:20:52 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ln.c (do_link): Give a diagnostic when trying to make a hard
	link to a nonexistent source file.  Before, running the command
	`ln -i no-such-file existing-file' and responding `yes' to the
	prompt would both remove `existing-file' and fail to make a link.
	Karl Berry reported the problem.

Sat Sep 10 04:34:34 1994  Roland McGrath  <roland@churchy.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* src/rm.c (remove_dir): Pass pathname to eaccess_stat.

Fri Sep  2 13:54:13 1994  Michael I Bushnell  <mib@geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu>

	* lib/Makefile.in (safe-lstat.c, safe-lstat.h, safe-stat.c,
	safe-stat.h): Use $(srcdir) to find source files.
	(.c.o): Use -I. to get safe-lstat.h and safe-stat.h from the
	build directory.
	* src/Makefile.in (incl): Add -I../lib to get lib/safe-lstat.h and
	lib/safe-stat.h from the build directory.

Sat Aug 27 16:33:04 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ln.c (main): Accept new option --no-dereference (-n).
	(do_link): If the destination command line argument is a symlink
	to a directory and --no-dereference is given, use that as the
	destination instead of the file in the directory.
	* ln.1: Document this.

	* system.h [BROKEN_STAT_MACROS]: Remove unnecessary #ifdef's.
	From Francois Pinard.

	* isdir.c, makepath.c, rename.c [STAT_MACRO_BROKEN]: Remove
	spurious #ifdef's.

Thu Aug 25 00:12:20 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* dd.c (copy): Clean up and fix off-by-one error when freeing
	the input buffer.

Thu Aug 18 11:41:16 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* du.c (du_files) [HAVE_FCHDIR]: Use open (".", ...) and fchdir
	instead of xgetcwd and chdir.  Otherwise, running du in a subdirectory
	of an unreadable directory would fail because xgetcwd fails.
	* configure.in (AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add fchdir.  AIX-2.3 (for one)
	doesn't have it.

	* lib/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Include getdate.c and posixtim.c
	so one doesn't need $(YACC).
	Add dependencies on safe-stat.h.

Sat Jul 30 08:08:02 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* du.c (main): Don't initialize automatic array CWD_ONLY in declaration.
	Some compilers don't allow that.

	* backupfile.c [DIRENT]: Remove spurious `|| defined(_POSIX_VERSION)'.
	* savedir.c: Ditto.

	* safe-xstat.c.in, safe-xstat.h.in: New files.
	* lib/Makefile.in: Add rules and dependencies for building safe-stat.c,
	safe-stat.h, safe-lstat.c, and safe-lstat.h from them.

	* eaccess.c (eaccess): Use SAFE_STAT instead of stat
	(and/or SAFE_LSTAT instead of lstat) to avoid unnecessary failure
	on systems for which stat (lstat) can return EINTR.
	* fsusage.c (statfs): Ditto.
	* isdir.c (isdir): Ditto.
	* makepath.c (make_path): Ditto.
	* rename.c (rename): Ditto.
	* chgrp.c (change_file_group): Ditto.
	* chmod.c (change_file_mode): Ditto.
	* chown.c (change_file_owner): Ditto.
	* cp-hash.c (remember_created): Ditto.
	* cp.c (main, do_copy): Ditto.
	* df.c (main, show_point): Ditto.
	* du.c (main, du_files, count_entry): Ditto.
	* install.c (copy_file): Ditto.
	* ln.c (main, do_link): Ditto.
	* ls.c (gobble_file): Ditto.
	* mv.c (is_real_dir, do_move): Ditto.
	* mvdir.c (main): Ditto.
	* rm.c (rm): Ditto.
	* touch.c (main, touch): Ditto.

	* Makefile.in (install): Tell GNU make that this target is .PHONY
	so it doesn't unnecessarily build ./install from install.sh.

Tue Jul 26 11:33:53 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* system.h: Remove `|| defined(_POSIX_VERSION)' from test that
	decides whether to include <fcntl.h>.  From Francois Pinard.

Sun Jul 03 08:44:00 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [AC_HAVE_HEADERS]: Add sys/param.h, for definition
	of HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H, now tested in pathmax.h.

	* makepath.c (make_path): Avoid spurious failure for file names
	that contain `/.' or `/..'.  From Andreas Schwab
	<schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

	* dd.c (main): Handle SIGPIPE like other interrupts.
	From Scott L. Burson <gyro@zeta-soft.com>.

	* df.c (main, show_dev, usage): New option --print-type=fstype.
	From Arne Henrik Juul.
	* df.1: Update.

Thu Jun 30 10:28:32 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.c (longdiff) [SIZEOF_INT == 2]: Choose which version of this
	macro to use based on SIZEOF_INT rather than obsolete INT_16_BITS.
	[INODE_DIGITS]: New macro.
	(print_long_format): Use it.
	(print_file_name_and_frills): Ditto.
	(length_of_file_name_and_frills): Ditto.
	(print_long_format): Add a couple casts to unsigned types.

	* ls.c: Change type name from `struct file' to `struct fileinfo'.
	David J. Mackenzie reported a name conflict on HPUX with the former.

	* dd.c (copy): Allocate an extra byte so I/O buffer begins on an
	even address.  This because the ITOS 3000WS running SEIUX 3.1
	(a descendant of MIPS RISC/OS 4.x) has SCSI device drivers that
	require the I/O buffer begin on an even address.  From
	Tilman Schmidt <tilman@gb1.sema.de>.

Mon Jun 20 23:45:34 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Use AC_PROGRAM_PATH to get values for LN, MV, RM.
	(AC_HAVE_FUNCS): Add getgroups.
	(AC_OUTPUT): Remove touch command.

	* eaccess.c (in_group): Remove static function.  Use group_member
	instead.
	(eaccess_stat, eaccess): Change calling sequence to take filename.
	Save UID and GID and use access if they are the same as effective IDs.
	(main) [TEST]: Test driver.
	* cp.c (copy): Update callers.
	* mv.c (do_move): Ditto.
	* rm.c (remove_file): Ditto.

	* cp.c (copy): With --preserve (-p) for non-root users, don't even
	try to preserve file ownership in chown call.  Otherwise, on systems
	with the mis-feature allowing non-root users to change file ownership,
	the subsequent chmod would fail.

	* userspec.c (parse_user_spec): Rewrite.  Be careful to free all
	allocated memory upon error.
	(main) [TEST]: Test driver.

	* src/Makefile.in (uninstall): Delete $(LIBPROGS) one at a time
	instead of like `rm -f $(libdir)/$(LIBPROGS)'.  The old way loses
	when LIBPROGS is empty and $(libdir) is a non-directory, and would
	lose if LIBPROGS could ever have more than one word.
	* (RM, LN, MV, INSTALL): Use values determined by ./configure instead
	of the newly built binaries so people can build with a cross
	compiler and still run `make (un)install.'

	* chgrp.c (change_file_group): Give a better error message when
	failing because the invoking user does not belong to the requested
	group.  This affects systems on which chown sets errno to EPERM
	for both `inaccessible file' and `user not a member of the specified
	group' errors.  Before, `chgrp bin file-I-own' would give the
	misleading and incorrect diagnostic `chgrp: file-I-own: Not owner'.
	Now it reports `you are not a member of group `bin''.
	Thomas A Peterson (tap@src.honeywell.com) reported this weakness.

	* long-options.c: Move from src/ to lib/.
	* long-options.h: Ditto.
	* src/Makefile.in: Remove references to long-options.[ch].
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add long-options.[co].

Sat Jun 18 15:45:34 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* du.c (count_entry): Print "/" instead of zero-length string.
	From Kjetil Torgrim Homme.

Sun May 29 13:43:50 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* group-member.c: New file.
	* lib/Makefile.in (SOURCES, OBJECTS): Add group-member.[co].

	* sync.c: New file.
	* Makefile.in (PROGS): Add sync.
	(SOURCES): Add sync.c
	* src/Makefile.in: Add rules and dependencies for sync.

	* configure.in: Use AC_SET_MAKE and AC_PROG_INSTALL.
	If AC_FUNC_CHECK doesn't find getgroups, add -lbsd if possible.
	This was reported by Tilman Schmidt <ts@gb1.sema.de>
	to be necessary on an ITOS 3000WS running SEIUX 3.1.

	* Makefile.in: Edit MAKE assignments into @SET_MAKE@.
	(Makefile): Remove dependencies on */Makefile.in.
	Change the rule so running config.status creates only Makefile.
	(stamp-config): Have config.status generate only config.h.

	* {lib,man,src}/Makefile.in (Makefile): Add single dependency on
	Makefile.in and rule to make config.status create only Makefile.

	* system.h: Move from lib to src.
	* src/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Add system.h.
	* lib/Makefile.in (DISTFILES): Remove system.h.

Mon Apr 18 19:54:24 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* documentation: Change uses of `pathname' and `path' as per
	GNU standards.

Fri Apr 15 20:41:15 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* mv.c (main): Give a reason for failure when given fewer than
	two non-option arguments, rather than just the pointer to --help.
	* ln.c (main): Ditto, but for no non-option arguments.

	* configure.in: Update for autoconf-1.8.
	Use AC_CHECKING instead of echo.
	Use AC_SIZEOF_TYPE instead of obsolete AC_INT_16_BITS.

Wed Apr 13 11:18:19 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cp.c (copy_reg): Correct off-by-DEV_BSIZE error in test for
	whether a file has holes.  From Michael Bushnell <mib@gnu.ai.mit.edu>.

Wed Mar 30 08:53:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Use AC_SET_MAKE.
	* Makefile.in: Edit MAKE assignments into @SET_MAKE@.

Mon Mar 14 11:01:09 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fsusage.c (adjust_blocks): Return -1 when FROMSIZE is non-positive.
	Suggestion from Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl.  He reported that df failed
	with divide by zero when trying to process an entry for an nfs file
	system mounted over a SLIP line after the SLIP connection had been
	broken.
	[convert_blocks]: Rename macro to CONVERT_BLOCKS.

Sat Jan 29 13:24:07 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* du.c (main): Call du_files (with ".") when there are no
	non-option arguments rather than treating that as a special case.
	(du_files): Ignore return value from count_entry.
	(count_entry): Accumulate file sizes into new global sum used for
	the -c option;  the return value is unchanged and is still used
	by recursive calls.  Now, using -S and -c together works.
	Add parentheses to clarify precedence.

Fri Jan 28 11:02:21 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Don't set LDFLAGS since linking now uses both
	LDFLAGS and CFLAGS.

Thu Jan 13 17:27:38 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in: Change all link commands to use both $(CFLAGS)
	and $(LDFLAGS).

Mon Jan 10 01:20:38 1994  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* man/Makefile.in (manprefix): Use binprefix as the default.

Thu Dec 30 23:11:10 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* The following changes are necessary to avoid spurious failures
	when a read or write system call is interrupted (e.g. by SIGTSTP).
	A POSIX implementation of those system calls may either return
	-1 and set errno to EINTR or return a positive value indicating
	that a partial read or write has completed successfully.  On Linux
	0.99.14, interrupted read and write system calls return -1/EINTR.
	Thanks to Bruno Haible <haible@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	for pointing this out.

	* full-write.c, safe-read.c: New files.

	* cp.c (copy_reg): Use full_write instead of write.  Handle
	errno == EINTR (instead of failing) after read system call.
	* dd.c (skip): Handle errno == EINTR (instead of failing) after
	read system call.
	(copy): Use safe_read instead of read.
	* install.c (copy_file): Use safe_read and full_write instead of
	read and write system calls.
	* mv.c (copy_reg): Ditto.
	* touch.c (utime_now): Ditto.

Tue Dec 28 15:49:32 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* install.sh: New file.
	Makefile.in [DISTFILES]: Add it.

Sat Dec 18 01:12:24 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Put `touch stamp-config' in second arg
	so it goes in config.status.  This eliminates unnecessary second run
	of configure.

Thu Nov 18 00:03:24 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [STAT_STATFS2_FSIZE]: Fix test (that had obsolete
	and now-broken use of AC_HEADER_EGREP) so that this flag is set
	for NetBSD 0.9.

Mon Oct 25 20:27:00 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cp-aux.c, df.c, install.c, ln.c, ls.c, mkdir.c, mkfifo.c,
	mknod.c, mv.c, touch.c: Use the preferred `--longopt=arg'
	syntax in --help message rather than `--longopt arg'.
	From Francois Pinard.

Tue Oct 19 07:02:18 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 3.9.

Mon Oct 18 00:13:40 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/*.c (usage): Now the usage message is simply
	"Try `%s --help' for more information.  From Francois Pinard.

	* src/Makefile.in [LIBPROGS]: Depend on ../lib/libfu.a and
	version.o.  From Francois Pinard.

	* src/*.c (usage): Remove blank line before "Try `%s --help..."
	in usage message.

Sun Oct 17 00:19:58 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fileblocks.c [!NINDIR]: Define BSIZE only if it's not already
	defined.

	* ls.c (print_long_format): Cast printf args major and minor
	so they'll have types matching %u format even on systems
	where those macros have signed type.

Sat Oct 16 00:25:42 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* chmod.c (change_file_mode): Reapply Oct 6 change for symlinks.
	Somehow it got removed from working sources.

	* lib/Makefile.in [OBJECTS]: Change dependency to ../config.h so
	it works when building in a subdirectory.  From Rick Sladkey
	(jrs@world.std.com).

Wed Oct 13 19:43:47 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cp.c (copy), ls.c (get_link_name): Complete Aug 27 change so
	that we use PATH_MAX + 1 rather than sizeof(char*) as size of
	buffer in readlink call.  This was causing spurious errors.

	* cp.c (copy), mv.c (do_move), rm.c (remove_file, remove_dir):
	Cast to `unsigned int' stat->st_mode printf arguments corresponding
	to %o formats to avoid warnings.

	* lib/Makefile.in [DEFS]: Remove -DMVDIR.  Add -DCONFIG_BROKETS.
	(rename.o): Add a specific rule.  Use -DMVDIR=... here instead.

	* src/Makefile.in [DEFS]: Add -DCONFIG_BROKETS.
	(distclean): Don't delete dir.c and vdir.c; they aren't
	created anymore.

	* lib/Makefile.in: Make all .o files depend on $(srcdir)/../config.h.
	* src/Makefile.in: Ditto.

Sun Oct 10 13:38:54 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/Makefile.in (dist): Depend on $(DISTFILES).

	* src/Makefile.in [libdir, LIBPROGS]: Define them.
	From Francois Pinard.

	* posixtm.y: [HAVE_CONFIG_H, CONFIG_BROKETS]: Include <config.h>
	or "config.h".  From Francois Pinard.

	* makepath.c: [HAVE_CONFIG_H, CONFIG_BROKETS]: Remove the duplicate
	#ifdef block following the alloca #ifdefs.  From Francois Pinard.

	* df.c: Remove unnecessary dcl of strstr.

Sat Oct  9 13:30:28 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in [STATFS_OSF1]: Change name to STAT_STATFS3_OSF1
	to be consistent with names of the other STAT_* macros.
	* acconfig.h: Ditto.
	* fsusage.c: Ditto.

	* acconfig.h: Add comments.
	* Makefile.in: Remove comments about -D flags that could be added
	to DEFS; now (using autoheader) those comments end up in config.h.

	* Makefile.in (configure, config.h.in): Warn that they may not be
	up to date.  Don't touch them.

	* ls.c (usage): Split long usage string between two fprintf
	statements to avoid default limit of SGI's cc on string length.

	* Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in [PROGS]: Alphabetize.

	* configure.in: Remove AC_UNISTD_H; add unistd.h to AC_HAVE_HEADERS.

Thu Oct 07 12:57:10 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, cp-aux.c, cp.c, dd.c, df.c, du.c,
	install.c, ln.c, ls.c, mkdir.c, mkfifo.c, mknod.c, mv.c, mvdir.c,
	rm.c, rmdir.c, touch.c (usage): Using --help gets long well-
	formatted help.  Now --help writes to stdout and exits successfully.
	From Francois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>.

	* lib/Makefile.in [libdir]: Make sure it's defined.

	* posixtm.y [!__GNUC__ && !HAVE_ALLOCA_H]: Declare alloca as void*
	rather than char*.  The latter conflicts with a dcl from bison.simple.

Wed Oct 06 18:22:00 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* chmod.c (change_file_mode): Add an argument to control how symbolic
	links are treated.
	(main, change_dir_mode): Reflect changed calling sequence.
	Now symlinks listed on the command line are processed (they
	were ignored before); the permissions of the dereferenced files are
	changed.  Symlinks encountered in recursive traversals are still
	ignored.  This makes GNU chmod act more like e.g. Sun's.
	From Nick Holloway <alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>.
	* chmod.1: Document it.

Tue Oct 05 14:52:02 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* configure.in: Add AC_STAT_MACROS_BROKEN.

	* isdir.c, makepath.c, rename.c, system.h [STAT_MACROS_BROKEN]:
	Test this.

	* install.c (install_file_in_dir): Use stpcpy instead of slow sprintf.

	* argmatch.c, backupfile.c, basename.c, dirname.c, eaccess.c,
	fileblocks.c, fsusage.c, getversion.c, idcache.c, isdir.c,
	makepath.c, mountlist.c, rename.c, savedir.c, stripslash.c,
	userspec.c, xgetcwd.c, xstrdup.c, yesno.c, [HAVE_CONFIG_H,
	CONFIG_BROKETS]: Include <config.h> or "config.h".

	* lib/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in [.c.o]: Put -I.. before
	-I$(srcdir) so <config.h> will get the right file.

	* chgrp.c, chmod.c, chown.c, cp-aux.c, cp-hash.c, cp.c, dd.c,
	df.c, du.c, install.c, ln.c, ls.c, mkdir.c, mkfifo.c, mknod.c,
	mv.c, mvdir.c, rm.c, rmdir.c, touch.c, version.c [HAVE_CONFIG_H,
	CONFIG_BROKETS]: Include <config.h> or "config.h".

	* configure.in [AC_CONFIG_HEADER]: Use it.

	* configure.in (rename.o) [MVDIR definition]: Remove it.
	* lib/Makefile.in [DEFS]: Put it here instead.

	* config.h.in, acconfig.h: New files
	* Makefile [DISTFILES]: Add them.
	(config.h.in): Add a rule to warn if it may need to be rebuilt.

	* lib/Makefile [YACC]: Get definition from @YACC@.

	* system.h: Include <unistd.h>.  This is needed for the definition
	of _POSIX_VERSION.

Thu Sep  9 08:52:10 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* src/*.c: Print version on standard output, not stderr.

Fri Aug 27 23:53:50 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cp.c (copy), ls.c (get_link_name): Don't use PATH_MAX as array
	length in declarations because on some systems it gets defined
	to the function pathconf.  Use dynamic allocation instead.

	* fsusage.c (adjust_blocks): Use `1' instead of `+1'.  Many
	compilers don't parse the latter.  From Kaveh R. Ghazi.

Thu Aug 26 22:26:09 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.c (print_long_format, print_file_name_and_frills): Cast inode
	number to unsigned long and print it with %lu to avoid warnings from
	gcc -Wformat because the size and type of ino_t are system dependent.

	* cp.c (do_copy): Plug a memory leak with --parents.

	* ln.c (main): Like mv and cp, convert `ln x y/' to ln x y/x
	when a is not a directory.
	[PATH_BASENAME_CONCAT]: New macro.
	(do_link): Use it here, too.

	* ls.c (sort_files): Add `default: abort();' clause to switch stmts.

	* cp.c (do_copy): Don't remove trailing slashes from source.

Wed Aug 25 21:40:00 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* cp.c: Add --parents as synonym for --path.  Change --path to
	--parents in comments.  --path is deprecated.

	* rm.c (clear_directory): Fix incorrect test for determining when
	to reallocate buffer.  Thanks to Ric Anderson <ric@CS.Arizona.EDU>.

Fri Aug 13 17:19:52 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* fsusage (adjust_blocks): Round away from zero -- this matters
	when computing the negative free-block count for disks that are
	more than 100% full.

	* mv.c (movefile): Use nested calls to stpcpy instead of sprintf.
	(is_real_dir): New function.
	(movefile): In addition to when dest is a directory, if dest has
	a trailing `/' and source is not a directory, presume the target
	is dest/`basename source`.  This converts `mv x y/' to `mv x y/x'
	when x is not a directory.  This change means that the command
	`mv any file/' will now fail rather than performing the move.

	* cp.c (do_copy): Similarly, convert `cp x y/' to cp x y/x when
	x is not a directory.

Wed Aug  4 17:43:18 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.c (get_link_name): Don't ever use the stat field st_size as a
	buffer size.  Too many systems don't set it properly for mount points.
	Instead, use a fixed-length buffer.  From Michael Joosten
	<joost@ori.CAdlab.DE>.
	* cp.c (copy): Ditto.

Mon Jul 19 17:39:01 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* backupfile.c (concat): Temporary STR1_LENGTH should have type `int'
	instead of `char.'

Fri Jul 16 22:00:16 1993  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@goldman.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* dd.c (print_stats): Change message from "truncated blocks"
	to "truncated records" for final POSIX.2 spec.

Fri Jun 25 17:18:15 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* mkdir.c, rmdir.c: Change --path long option to --parents to avoid
	confusion with search-path semantics of --path as an option to other
	programs.  --path will still work, but is no longer documented.

Tue Jun  8 00:46:26 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* dd.c (parse_integer): Also accept `c' multiplier for consistency
	with find's -size option.

Thu May 27 00:03:51 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* Version 3.8.

	* configure.in (STAT_OSF1): Reference the statfs f_fsize member
	so that configure defines STAT_OSF1 only if there is such a member.
	Without such a reference, a Pyramid MIServer running OSx 5.1
	improperly defined STAT_OSF1 instead of the one it needed:
	STAT_STATFS2_BSIZE.

Wed May 26 00:57:46 1993  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* ls.h, ls-ls.c ls-dir.c, ls-vdir.c: New files that define or
	simply set the new global variable ls_mode.  ls_mode defines whether
	the executable built from ls.o should act like ls, dir, or vdir.
	* ls.c (decode_switches): Use the variable instead of #ifdefs.
	This is modelled after the approach used in GNU binutils 2.x for

	Don't call chown if we can efficiently determine that doing so is
	unnecessary.  On some systems, calls to chown (even with your own
	uid and gid) fail unless made by root.  On such systems install
	got spurious failures.

	conflict with standard header files.

	* cp.c (copy_reg): Instead of using NO_SPARSE_FILES, use

	* Version 1.4.

	* cp.h: Declare free returning void, not int, so it

	* ln.c (do_link): Take out code to give an error if source and
	dest are the same file.  The dubious usefulness of the special
	case to prevent 'ln x x' from removing 'x' (ln -i can be used

	0 (as on pipe reads on some systems), use BSIZE instead.

	control whether st_blksize and st_blocks are used.
	* Makefile, system.h, backupfile.c: Use DIRENT to control

	(usage): Document it.
