2002-07-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.12.

	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.6b.

	* TODO: Remove entry that mentions rm's HAVE_WORKING_READDIR.
	Since remove.c was rewritten, rm is no longer susceptible to that.

2002-07-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c: Don't include malloc.h -- it was unnecessary.

2002-07-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.11.

	* src/stat.c (usage): The short form of --dereference is now -L, not -l.
	Reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo.

	* src/rm.c: Add new option, --presume-input-tty, for testing only.
	Not documented.

	This test might remove a file owned by the person running `make check'.
	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Hoist definition of $target_file, and use
	that (not $f) in test for owner/dir/symlink.  Patch by Michael Stone.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Handle the case in which rm produces no output.

	rm would prompt for a symlink to an unwritable file
	* src/remove.c (prompt): When not interactive, don't prompt
	for a symlink.  Reported by Dave Beckett.  Patch by Michael Stone.
	* tests/rm/dangling-symlink: Add a test for the above-fixed bug.

2002-07-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Use file_name_lookup, not getdport.
	Patch by Alfred M. Szmidt.

	* Makefile.maint (news-r1, news-r2): Define.  Better regexp.
	(announcement): Use them here.  Also makes the line length < 80.

	* Upgrade to cvs automake -- required to work with 2.53b.
	* configure.ac: Require automake-1.6a.

	* Version 4.1.10.

	* Upgrade to gettext-0.11.3.
	* Upgrade to autoconf-2.53b.

2002-07-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add .wav.

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: Don't expect `ARGV_0=$0 exec ...' to work.
	It doesn't work with /bin/sh of Solaris5.6.
	Use an explicit `export ARGV_0' instead.
	[comparing actual and expected output]: Don't match the entire line,
	but rather just the `rm: cannot remove `$dir/$f':' part.

	* tests/rm/dangling-symlink: Use input-tty rather than
	testing for /dev/stdin.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add input-tty.
	* tests/input-tty: New file.

2002-07-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add the following to the list of colorizable

	New image suffixes: .jpeg .pbm .pgm .tiff .mpeg .xcf .xwd
	Audio suffixes: .ogg .mp3
	From Michael Stone.

2002-07-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Use memcpy and a little pointer arithmetic,
	rather than stpncpy.

2002-07-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Under some circumstances, rm would fail due to a lack of
	permissions, but give a misleading diagnostic like this:
	rm: cannot chdir from `.' to `foo': Not a directory
	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Detect the case in which unlinking a
	non-directory fails with EPERM, and give an appropriate diagnostic.
	Reported by Michael Stone.

2002-07-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/rm/fail-eperm: New file/test, for the above.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add fail-eperm.

	* src/stat.c (print_it): Use xstrdup, not strdup.
	Use strspn to avoid an explicit loop.
	Use fputc rather than printf "\n".

	* src/stat.c: Include quote.h.
	(print_stat): Use xreadlink, rather than using readlink directly.
	Use the quote function rather than hard-coded double quotes.

	* src/df.c (show_dev): Make the `Use%' column align with
	its heading, even when -P is used with -h or -H.

2002-07-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* man/du.x: Add a description of --exclude=PATTERN.
	* src/du.c (usage) [--exclude]: Use PATTERN rather than PAT.
	From Martin Michlmayr.

2002-07-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	I added stat.x, but didn't update the definition of dist_man_MANS.
	* man/Makefile.am (dist_man_MANS): Add stat.1.
	(stat.1): Add dependency.
	Reported by Michael Stone.

	Ensure that the above never happens again.
	* man/Makefile.am (check-x-vs-1): New target.
	(check-local): Depend on check-x-vs-1.

	* src/mv.c (euidaccess): Remove declaration.  It was unused.
	From Michael Stone.
	(yesno): Remove declaration.  It too was unused.

2002-07-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com:

	* NEWS: df now rounds all quantities up, as per POSIX.
	This fixes a bug where df would report Size < Used.
	* doc/coreutils.texi: Likewise.
	* src/df.c (df_readable): Omit last arg; we always round up now.
	All callers changed.

2002-07-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi:
	New ls time style: long-iso, which generates YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.
	Any time style can be preceded by "posix-".
	The default time style is now posix-long-iso instead of posix-iso.

	* src/ls.c (enum time_style): Remove posix_iso_time_style.
	Add long_iso_time_style.
	(time_style_args, time_style_types, decode_switches): Likewise.
	(decode_switches): If a time style is prefixed by "posix-", ignore
	it if in the POSIX locale.  Default style is now posix-long-iso.
	(usage): Explain the above.

2002-07-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (envvar-check): Mark as `.PHONY'.

	* src/stat.c: Remove everything associated with --secure option.

2002-07-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (prompt): Fix test for write-protectedness to also
	check errno == EACCES.  Otherwise, `rm dangling-symlink' would
	mistakenly prompt.  Reported by Mike Castle.

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dangling-symlink.
	* tests/rm/dangling-symlink: New file/test, for the above fix.

2002-07-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c (usage): Rename --link/-l to --dereference/-L.
	Describe --secure.
	Describe --format.

	* src/chgrp.c, src/chmod.c, src/chown.c, src/cp.c, src/dd.c (usage):
	Use the PACKAGE_BUGREPORT e-mail address, rather than hard-coding it.
	* src/df.c, src/dircolors.c, src/du.c, src/install.c: Likewise.
	* src/link.c, src/ln.c, src/ls.c, src/mkdir.c, src/mkfifo.c: Likewise.
	* src/mknod.c, src/mv.c, src/rm.c, src/rmdir.c, src/shred.c: Likewise.
	* src/stat.c, src/sync.c, src/touch.c, src/unlink.c: Likewise.

2002-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/touch/fail-diag: Handle yet another different diagnostic.
	Report from Volker Borchert.

2002-06-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c (print_statfs): Use `fputc ('*', stdout)'
	instead of the combination of strcat and printf.
	(print_statfs) [!FLASK_LINUX]: Print `*' for %S and %C,
	rather than `S' and `C'.
	(print_stat) [!FLASK_LINUX]: Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (AD_mark_current_as_unremovable): Replace dead
	code with an assertion.

2002-06-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls-test: Use grep, not egrep.

2002-06-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (prompt): Add a comment to help translators work
	around the problem of making the translations of the adjective
	`write-protected' and the corresponding run-time-variable noun
	(e.g., file, directory, symlink, etc.) consistent.  From Paul Eggert.

2002-06-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c (usage): Add missing open-quote.
	Reported by Michael Piefel.

2002-06-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.9.

	* configure.ac: Invoke AC_GNU_SOURCE very early.

	* tests/rm/rm1: Accommodate the  slightly different diagnostic we
	get on some systems, due to `unlink (dir)' failing with EACCES
	rather than EPERM.  E.g. for ReiserFS on Linux-2.4.18.

2002-06-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (wget-update): Checkout into config/.
	Warn when skipping a file.

	* src/stat.c: Include sys/statvfs.h.
	[!HAVE_SYS_STATVFS_H && !HAVE_SYS_VFS_H]: Include sys/param.h
	and sys/mount.h, to get decl of struct statfs on NetBSD 1.5.2.
	(NAMEMAX_FORMAT, STRUCT_STATVFS): Define.
	(HAVE_STRUCT_STATXFS_F_TYPE, SB_F_NAMEMAX): Define.
	Remove `static' attribute from decl of program_name.
	(human_fstype): Use f_basetype or f_fstypename if available.
	(print_human_time): Use nstrftime and an ISO format string, in
	place of strftime with `%c'.  The latter is too locale-dependent.
	(print_statfs): Deal with lots of portability issues: some fields
	are available only with statfs, others only with statvfs, and
	some are available in both, but with different types.
	(do_statfs) [DEFAULT_FORMAT_TERSE]: Factor out.
	[DEFAULT_FORMAT_VERBOSE]: Likewise.

	* src/copy.c: Change all `preserving ...' diagnostics to

	in cpp directives.

2002-06-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/setgid-check: Interpret a permissions string of
	drwxr-xr-x (DOS/Windows) as meaning the cwd is not setgid.
	Reported by Rich Dawe.

2002-05-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for new ls option --author, for GNU/Hurd.
	Derived from a suggestion by Alfred M. Szmidt.

	* doc/coreutils.texi (ls invocation), NEWS: Document this.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES): Check for st_author.
	* src/ls.c (st_author) [! HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_AUTHOR]: New macro.
	(print_author): New var.
	(AUTHOR_OPTION): New enum val.
	(long_options, decode_switches, print_long_format, usage):
	Support --author.
	(format_user): New function.
	(print_long_format): Use it.  Make print buffer a bit bigger.

2002-06-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/sample-test (trap): Make sure the temporary hierarchy is
	writable before removing it.

	* tests/mv/perm-1: New file, to demonstrate fix of 2002-06-12.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add perm-1.

	* src/system.h: For GNU libc 2.2 and newer, ensure that <sys/types.h>
	has been included before this file.

2002-06-13  Richard Dawe  <richdawe@bigfoot.com>

	Accommodate DOS file name limitations.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Change temp. file name: s/\.err/_err/, for DOS.
	* tests/mv/force: Similar.
	* tests/mv/into-self: Similar.
	* tests/touch/no-rights: Similar.
	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Remove leading `.' from temp. names.

2002-06-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sys2.h (S_ISNAM): Add to list of S_IS* macros.
	Rearrange #if directives for each S_IS macro.
	From diffutils-2.8.2.

2002-06-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/mv.c (do_move): Give one diagnostic, not two, when unable to
	unlink a destination file.  This bug was introduced in fileutils-3.16l.

2002-06-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/part-fail: Also accept the permission-denied diagnostic
	issued by some losing systems.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Use DT_IS_DIR only if
	HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE is defined.

2002-06-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	`rm' no longer uses explicit recursion, and as such is now able
	to remove hierarchies of effectively unlimited depth.  Prior to
	this change, on typical systems, rm would fail (segfault) to remove
	hierarchies of depth greater than about 25,000.

	* src/remove.c: Merge in all changes from no-recursion branch.
	See below for details.
	* src/remove.h: Likewise.
	* src/mv.c (do_move): Adapt to new calling sequence for rm.
	* src/rm.c (main): Likewise.

2002-06-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/rm/r-2: Adjust, now that we no longer report
	`removing all entries of directory ...'.
	* tests/rm/r-1: Likewise.

	* src/remove.c (enum Ternary): Define type.
	(prompt): Add a parameter.  Adjust callers.
	(remove_entry): Attempt rmdir here, only if a directory is
	`known' to be empty.  Significant rework.
	(remove_dir): Propagate failure `up' also when rmdir fails.

2002-06-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add rm5.
	* tests/rm/rm5: New test.

2002-05-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	In interactive mode, prompt only once about an empty directory.
	* src/remove.c (enum Prompt_action): Define.
	(prompt): Two new parameters.  Adjust all callers.

	Performance.
	* src/remove.c (remove_entry) [!ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS]:
	Don't call rmdir here.

2002-05-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (AD_pop_and_chdir): Don't use errno (it's not valid)
	in diagnostic for changed dev/ino.
	(remove_entry): Tweak diagnostic.

2002-05-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS): Define.
	(AD_pop_and_chdir): Propagate status as we traverse back `up' the tree.
	(DO_UNLINK, DO_RMDIR): Define.
	(remove_entry) [ROOT_CAN_UNLINK_DIRS]: Add code so this works also on
	systems where root can use `unlink' to remove directories.

2002-05-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Adapt for changed format of --verbose output.

2002-05-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c: Include file-type.h.
	Include file type in prompt when asking whether to remove file.
	Based on a patch from Paul Eggert.

	* src/remove.c (prompt): Add comment.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Fix another (known) leak.

	* tests/rm/rm3: Don't depend on order of traversal of dir entries.
	It is nondeterministic on some types of filesystems.

	* src/remove.c (hash_freer): New function.
	(AD_mark_helper): Use it.
	(AD_mark_as_unremovable): xstrdup the filename argument.
	(remove_dir): Free directory name.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Fail also when trying to remove a
	directory without the --recursive option.
	Change a diagnostic, s/unlink/remove/, now that it can apply also
	to a directory.

	* src/remove.c (is_empty_dir): New function.
	(prompt): New function, factored out of...
	(remove_entry): ...here.  Call it.
	(remove_dir): Call prompt before rmdir.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): Add support for prompting (e.g., -i).

	* src/remove.h (UPDATE_STATUS): New macro.
	Include save-cwd.h.
	(struct File_spec): Remove declaration.
	Update prototypes.

	* src/remove.c [AD_ent] (status): New member.  This lets us propagate
	the status from a subdirectory to its parent via AD_pop_and_chdir.
	(AD_push_initial): Set it.
	(AD_push): Likewise.
	(remove_cwd_entries): Change return type to enum RM_status, and
	adjust all callers.
	(rm): Use UPDATE_STATUS rather than open-coding it.

	* src/remove.c (remove_entry): New function, factored out of...
	(remove_cwd_entries): ...here, and...
	(rm_1): ...here.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Add support for --verbose.

	* tests/rm/rm1: New file.
	* tests/rm/rm2: New file.
	* tests/rm/unread2: New file.
	* tests/rm/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add rm1, rm2, and unread2.

	* src/remove.h (enum RM_status) [RM_NONEMPTY_DIR]: New member.

2002-05-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Free cwd_state, if necessary.

2002-05-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (rm_1): Remove now useless (always true)
	user_specified_name parameter.  Adjust sole caller.

	* src/remove.c (rm): New function.  This interface allows
	one to remove multiple arguments at a time.  This is important in
	that it allows us to hide the remove_init/remove_fini functions and
	the cwd_state parameter.
	(rm_1): Renamed from rm.
	(remove_init, remove_fini): Remove functions.  Each body is now
	part of `rm'.
	* src/remove.h (rm): Update prototype.

2002-06-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c: Remove use of D_TYPE_IN_DIRENT, now that that symbol
	has been renamed.

2002-05-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Use a temporary to avoid a warning
	from gcc -W about comparison between signed and unsigned.
	(copy_internal): Likewise, but use a cast.

2002-05-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/sys2.h (S_ISREG, S_ISDIR): Define if not already defined.
	(S_TYPEISSEM, S_TYPEISSHM, S_TYPEISTMO): Likewise.

	* src/ls.c (S_ISLNK, S_ISFIFO, S_ISSOCK, S_ISCHR, S_ISBLK, S_ISDOOR):
	Remove definitions.
	* src/sys2.c (S_ISLNK, S_ISFIFO, S_ISSOCK, S_ISCHR, S_ISBLK, S_ISDOOR):
	Define here instead.

2002-04-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (cycle_check): New function containing code factored
	out of remove_dir.  The sole difference is that upon detecting a
	cycle, rm now dies unconditionally.  Before, in interactive mode,
	it would ask the user whether to continue.
	(remove_dir): Call cycle_check.

2002-04-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Avoid new warnings from gcc.
	* src/dd.c: Declare input_file and output_file to be `const'.
	(skip): Declare `file' parameter to be `const', too.

	Remove hash table, active_dir_map, used to detect directory cycles.
	Instead, detect them lazily with just O(1) memory.
	Suggestion from Andi Kleen.
	* src/remove.c (is_power_of_two): New function.
	(print_nth_dir, make_active_dir_ent): Remove functions.
	(hash_active_dir_ent, hash_compare_active_dir_ents): Likewise.
	(remove_dir): Check for cycles here, ...
	(rm): ... and don't check for cycles here.

	* src/remove.c (rm): Call fspec_get_full_mode here, rather than
	fspec_get_filetype_mode.  We want to get the dev/ino earlier, and
	at the same time as when we get the file type, to avoid the risk
	that an attacker would change e.g. a directory to a symlink before
	we record its dev/ino.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_FILES): Remove intl/Makefile.
	(AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Add external arg.

	* intl/: Remove directory.
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove intl.
	(DISTCLEANFILES): Remove definition.

	* src/sys2.h: Remove ENABLE_NLS-related code.
	(_, N_) Remove definitions.
	Include "gettext.h" instead.

	* src/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Remove -I../intl.

2002-04-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Call exit with EXIT_FAILURE, not `1'.

2002-04-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/*: Clean up.

	* tests/sample-test: Use a temporary directory named
	`basename $0`.tmp/$$.  Create with mkdir -p.

	* tests/cp/backup-1: Use better trap, etc.
	* tests/mkdir/p-2: Use better trap.
	* tests/mkdir/p-1: Likewise.
	* tests/mkdir/concurrent-1: Likewise.

	* tests/rm/deep-1: Set $tmp the new way.

	* tests/rm/i-1: Likewise.
	* tests/rm/f-1: Likewise.

	* tests/sample-test: Use automatically-derived name for temporary
	directory.  This is more 8.3-friendly.  Based on a suggestion from
	Richard Dawe.

	* tests/sample-test: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add sample-test.

2002-04-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Don't report errors for nonexistent files
	when --no-create is in effect.  Based on a patch from TAKAI Kousuke.
	* tests/touch/no-create-missing: New file/test for above.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-create-missing.

2002-04-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c: Add copyright comment.
	(human_fstype): Rename from print_human_fstype, and rework accordingly.
	(print_statfs): Use human_fstype to honor format width on %T.

2002-04-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Handle "lld" vs "ld" printf formats the same way Bash does.

	(PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX): Define, if not already defined.
	(print_statfs): Use those macros, not the literal strings.
	(print_stat): Likewise.
	Suggestion from Paul Eggert.

	* src/stat.c (print_human_fstype): Add missing `break;'
	for `case S_MAGIC_MINIX:'.

2002-04-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c (statfs_secure): Define.
	(print_stat): Remove another #ifdef.
	(do_statfs): Likewise.
	(print_statfs): Prefer/use fputs over printf.
	(print_stat): Likewise.

	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add stat.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add fs.h.

	* src/stat.c [HAVE_SYS_VFS_H]: Guard incluion of sys/vfs.h.
	Constify many parameters.
	(print_statfs): Fix typo: Use %u (to match %lu) for namelen, not %d.
	(verbose_usage): Remove function.  Move contents into usage.
	Remove lots of #if directives involving FLASK_LINUX
	[!FLASK_LINUX] (is_flask_enabled): Define.
	(stat_secure, lstat_secure): Define.
	(print_statfs): Remove lots of nested #if directives.
	Instead, rely on support fo %llu and %lld printf formats --
	but that is only temporary, since it's not porable enough.
	(main): Hoist is_flask_enabled test to be done here, rather
	than in each of do_stat and do_statfs for every argument.

2002-04-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/stat.c: Include system.h, error.h, and many other headers.
	[HAVE_SYS_SYSMACROS_H]: Guard inclusion of sys/sysmacros.h.
	(PROGRAM_NAME, AUTHORS): Define.
	(long_options): Declare/define.
	(print_human_access): Rewrite to use mode_string.
	(usage): Rewrite.
	(main): Use getopt_long.
	(print_human_type): Call fputs once rather than calling
	printf many times.
	(print_human_fstype): Revamp in a similar fashion.  Don't use strdup.
	Declare most functions to be `static'.

2002-04-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (LDADD): List ../lib/libfetish.a both before
	and after @LIBINTL@.  Thanks to Paul Eggert for the fix and to
	Bruno Haible for diagnosing the problem.

	* src/link.c: Include long-options.h.
	[long_opts]: Remove.
	(usage): Tweak --help output; use *_OPTION_DESCRIPTION macros.
	(main): Don't use getopt directly.  Use parse_long_options instead.
	Tweak a diagnostic.
	Use EXIT_FAILURE rather than a literal `1'.
	* src/unlink.c: Likewise.
	(main): If POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, don't recognize --help or --version,
	so the program can operate on a file with one of those names.

2002-04-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	New programs link and unlink.

	* src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add link and unlink.
	* src/link.c, src/unlink.c: New files, from Debian's fileutils_4.1-10.
	Written by Michael Stone.

	* man/link.x: New file.
	* man/unlink.x: New file.
	* man/Makefile.am: Add link and unlink.

2002-04-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/install/basic-1: Tweak comments to reflect reality.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Add VERBOSE=yes support.
	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Fix typo in VERBOSE=yes handling.
	Reported by Richard Dawe.

2002-03-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.8.

	* tests/mv/i-link-no: Use --reply=no rather than -i.
	The latter depends on whether stdin is a tty and hence would
	fail in some situations where --reply=no doesn't.

	* src/mv.c (do_move): Correct a comment.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Move the block that sets `earlier_file'
	down to just before the first use of that variable.  Otherwise, it was
	possible to make mv (and probably cp, too) malfunction when copying
	hard-linked files into a directory containing at least one of the
	source file names.  Call forget_created everywhere thereafter where
	this function returns without creating a destination file that might
	subsequently be linked.  Reported by Iida Yosiaki.
	* src/cp-hash.c (forget_created): New function.
	* src/cp-hash.h (forget_created): Prototype.

	* tests/mv/i-link-no: New test for the above.
	Based on an example from Iida Yosiaki.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add i-link-no.

2002-03-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal) [move_mode]: Give a better diagnostic,
	by using errno from the failed unlink, when a cross-device `mv'
	fails, e.g., because the destination cannot be unlinked.
	Prompted by a report from Karl Berry.
	* tests/mv/part-fail: New test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add part-fail.

2002-03-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (datadir): Don't override $(datadir)
	which might be set by --datadir and different from $(prefix)/share.
	Patch from Albert Chin-A-Young.

2002-03-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.7.

	* src/ln.c (main): Change wording in diagnostic.
	* src/cp.c (do_copy): Likewise.
	* src/install.c (strip): Likewise.
	Suggestions from Santiago Vila.

	* Use autoconf-2.53.  Regenerate dependent files.

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP, BZIP2): Remove definitions.
	($(my_distdir).tar.bz2): Remove rule.  Now, it's built by `make dist'.

	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Specify the required version
	of automake (1.6), and options (gnits dist-bzip2), rather than...
	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): ...here.  Remove definition.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Don't exit upon finding a replaced file.
	Instead, just skip it like the diagnostic says.
	Reported by Paul Eggert.

2002-03-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Use a more concise diagnostic for
	reporting replaced files.  This avoids a bug in the code,
	which mishandled ino_t wider than long.
	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): Likewise, twice.

2002-03-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove config/config.rpath,
	now that automake knows about it.

2002-03-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Don't allow a malicious user to trick another user's rm process into
	removing unintended files.  In one scenario, if root is removing a
	hierarchy that is writable by the malicious user, that user may trick
	root into removing all of `/'.  Reported by Wojciech Purczynski.

	* src/remove.c (remove_dir): After chdir `..', call lstat to get the
	dev/inode of "." and fail if they aren't the same as the old numbers.
	(remove_cwd_entries): New parameter, `cwd_dev_ino'.
	(remove_dir): Likewise.
	(rm): Likewise.
	Adjust all callers.
	* src/mv.c (do_move): The first time we resort to copy/remove,
	call lstat `.' to get the device/inode numbers now required for rm.
	* src/rm.c (main): Call lstat `.' to get the device/inode numbers
	now required for rm.
	* src/remove.h (struct dev_ino): Declare new type.
	(rm): Add a parameter to the prototype.

2002-03-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Use automake-1.6.  Regenerate dependent files.

2002-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add config/config.rpath.

2002-03-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (tgz-size): Also handle a suffix of `K', since
	the sizes in the output of `du -h' now look like `29K'

2002-03-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.6.

2002-03-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Make cp -r equivalent to cp -R.  Add a new cp option --copy-contents
	for people who want to emulate the traditional (and rarely desirable)
	cp -r behavior.

	* src/cp.c (COPY_CONTENTS_OPTION): New enum value.
	(long_opts): Add --copy-contents.
	(usage): Describe new behavior.  Sort options.
	(main): Implement new behavior.  Remove diagnostics for -a and -r;
	no longer needed.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Remove -r warning; no longer needed.

	* NEWS: Document this.

2002-03-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): For each symlink copied by cp -r,
	issue a warning that `cp -r' is not portable.

	* src/cp.c (main): Revert change of 2001-12-29.  With this change,
	cp -r once again preserves symlinks.
	(usage): Document the original (now-restored) behavior.
	* tests/cp/r-vs-symlink: Reflect changed semantics of cp's -r option.

	* src/cp.c (main): Warn when -r is specified before --archive (-a).
	* src/cp.c (main): Fail when -r is specified after --archive (-a)
	on the command line.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Detect abuse of a race condition
	whereby an unprivileged user could gain read access to otherwise-
	inaccessible files when root uses cp or mv to copy a hierarchy
	belonging to that user.

2002-02-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches, usage): Add --time-style=+FORMAT.
	* doc/coreutils.texi (Formatting file timestamps): Document it.

2002-02-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add ACL support to 'ls' for HP-UX and Unixware, and try to
	establish a framework for adding it for other hosts.
	This builds on a suggestion of Andreas Gruenbacher.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libfetish_a_SOURCES): Add acl.h, acl.c.
	* lib/acl.h, lib/acl.c, m4/acl.m4: New files.
	* m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_MACROS): Require AC_FUNC_ACL.
	Do not check for acl or sys/acl.h, as AC_FUNC_ACL does that now.
	* src/ls.c: Include "acl.h" rather than <sys/acl.h>.
	(USE_ACL): Remove; replaced by HAVE_ACL everywhere.
	(gobble_file): Use file_has_acl rather than doing it ourselves.

2002-02-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/touch.c: Include posixver.h.
	(usage): Document only the intersection of the old and new behaviors,
	to encourage portability.
	(main): Use `posix2_version ()' in place of POSIX2_VERSION.

2002-02-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* ABOUT-NLS, intl/*: Update to Gettext 0.11.
	* INSTALL: Update to Autoconf 2.52h.

	* src/Makefile.am (datadir): Use `share' in place of @DATADIRNAME@,
	per Gettext-0.11.
	(LDADD): Use @LIBINTL@ instead of @INTLLIBS@, per Gettext-0.11.

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): New macro invocation.
	(ALL_LINGUAS): Remove: now in po/LINGUAS as per Gettext 0.11.

	* config: New subdirectory, containing the following files from .:
	config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, missing, install-sh, mkinstalldirs.
	Move the following files here from doc: texinfo.tex, mdate-sh.

2002-02-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/ls/infloop: Use `head -n 7', not `head -7'.
	* tests/rm/hash: Likewise.

2002-02-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Add Hungarian (hu).

2002-02-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/shred.c: (VERBOSE_UPDATE): Update every 5 seconds, not every 10.
	(wipename): Quote file names only when necessary.
	(main): Copy quoted string into malloc'd storage so it doesn't
	get clobbered when using -u and --verbose.

	Minor clean-up.
	* src/shred.c:
	Use `NULL' rather than `(time_t *) 0'.
	(dopass): Use STREQ in place of strcmp.
	Add parentheses around use of nested ternary operator.

2002-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/shred.c (VERBOSE_UPDATE): Now counts seconds, not bytes.

	(dopass): If verbose, output a line every VERBOSE_UPDATE seconds,
	and suppress duplicate output lines.  Output a percentage as well
	as a count of bytes.

	Also, fix comment/code typo regarding how many bytes have been
	written; this typo was harmless before, but is no longer harmless with
	the above change in effect.

2002-02-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/remove.c (rm): Add a comment.

2002-01-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Require automake-1.5d.
	* configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use zero-arg form of this macro.

2002-01-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/xmemcoll.c

	* src/chown-core.c: Don't include "xalloc.h", as system.h already
	does that via sys2.h.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.
	* src/shred.c: Likewise.

2002-01-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c: Avoid undefined behavior when strcoll fails,
	by resorting the directory with strcmp instead.

	Include <setjmp.h>.
	Include "quote.h".
	(compare_atime, rev_cmp_atime, compare_ctime, rev_cmp_ctime,
	compare_mtime, rev_cmp_mtime, compare_size, rev_comp_size,
	compare_name, rev_cmp_name, compare_extension, rev_cmp_extension,
	compare_version, rev_compare_version): Move before use, so that
	we can remove the forward declaration.  Reimplement in terms of
	the new functions described below, using xstrcoll instead of strcoll.
	(failed_strcoll): New var.
	(xstrcoll): New function.
	(V): New type.
	(cmp_ctime, compstr_ctime, rev_str_ctime): New functions.
	(cmp_mtime, compstr_mtime, rev_str_mtime): Likewise.
	(cmp_atime, compstr_atime, rev_str_atime): Likewise.
	(cmp_size, compstr_size, rev_str_size): Likewise.
	(cmp_version): Likewise.
	(cmp_name, compstr_name, rev_str_name): Likewise.
	(cmp_extension, compstr_extension, rev_str_extension): Likewise.
	(sort_files): Use prototype for internal function var.
	If the strcoll-based comparison fails, fall back on a strcmp-based one.

2002-01-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Ensure that the two version numbers in configure.ac remain in sync.
	* Makefile.maint (local-check): Depend on ac-check.
	(ac_p_pkg, AC_INIT_PKG): Define.
	(ac_p_ver, AC_INIT_VER): Define.
	(ac-check): New rule.

2002-01-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.ac: Remove code that set LIBOBJS in support of ansi2knr.
	The latest version of autoconf objected to it, and besides, I don't
	care too much about K&R support these days.

2002-01-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/touch.c (main): Issue a warning for obsolete usage, unless
	POSIXLY_CORRECT.

2002-01-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Add support for POSIX 1003.1-2001, which requires removal for
	support of the obsolete `touch [-acm] MMDDhhmm[YY] FILE...' syntax.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/touch.c (usage, main): Implement this.

2002-01-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Avoid giving a misleading diagnostic in some unusual cases.
	Instead, give one that makes sense.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Don't treat errno==ENOENT as a special case.
	(same_file_ok): Detect a case that would have lead to the errno==ENOENT
	condition above (and a misleading diagnostic), and return 0 so we give
	a diagnostic about the source and destination being the same file.
	(copy_internal): Use an explicit test for errno==EXDEV to detect
	that rename has failed because source and destination are on
	different devices.  This reverts part of a change from 1997-12-13,
	and is to avoid letting a race condition evoke a bogus diagnostic.
	Note that while POSIX has encouraged the errno==EXDEV test for
	years, it was inadequate back in 1997.	I'm hoping that many
	more systems have conforming support these days.
	Reported by Michael Gaughen <mgaughen@polyserve.com>

	* src/shred.c (usage): Also mention Ext3.
	Suggestion from Göran Uddeborg.

2002-01-06  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	* src/ls.c (long_time_format): Extend translator comments.

2002-01-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.5.

2001-12-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cp.c (main): With -r, always dereference symlinks.
	Reported by Christian Harkort.  Patch by Chris J. Bednar.

	* tests/cp/r-vs-symlink: New file to test for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add r-vs-symlink.

2001-12-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/shred.c [!HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Remove cpp block that duplicated
	code in lib/ in order to facilitate compiling this program without
	config.h.

2001-12-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/shred.c: Add FSF copyright notice.

2001-12-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use notation compatible with SI and with IEC 60027-2.
	For example, --block-size=1MB now means --block-size=1000000,
	whereas --block-size=1MiB now means --block-size=1048576.
	A trailing `B' now means decimal, not binary; this is a silent change.
	-H or --si now outputs the trailing 'B', for consistency with this.
	Programs now output trailing 'K' (not 'k') to mean 1024.
	New df, du short option -B is short for --block-size.
	You can omit an integer `1' before a block size suffix,
	e.g. `df -BG' is equivalent to `df -B 1G' and to `df --block-size=1G'.

	* NEWS, doc/coreutils.texi: Document this.  Remove documentation
	for obsolescent constructs MD, --kilobytes, -m or --megabytes.

	* src/dd.c (usage, parse_integer): Prefer K to k for 1024.
	* src/shred.c (usage, main): Likewise.

	* src/shred.c (xstrtoumax): If there is no number but there
	is a valid suffix, assume 1.  "MB" now means decimal, "MiB" binary.
	Accept 'K' as well as 'k'.

	* src/dd.c (usage): MD -> MB for decimal.

	* src/df.c (BLOCK_SIZE_OPTION): Remove; no longer needed now that
	we have 'B'.
	(long_options, usage, main): Add -B.
	(usage): Deprecate --kilobytes, -m, --megabytes.
	Document size suffixes.
	* src/du.c: Likewise.
	* src/ls.c (usage): Deprecate --kilobytes.  Document size suffixes.

	* src/df.c (print_header, show_dev): Enlarge column widths for
	trailing "B".

2001-12-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (real_dir): Remove unused variable.
	(url_dir_list): Don't set define it here, but...
	* Makefile.cfg (url_dir_list): ...define it here instead.
	(hosts, a_host, b_host): Remove now-unused variables.
	(alpha_subdir, a_url_dir, b_url_dir): Remove now-unused variables.

2001-12-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.4.

	* tests/touch/fail-diag: Also accept SunOS4's `Not owner' diagnostic.
	Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* tests/help-version: Fail also if ./$i --version fails.
	Run each --help and --version test with a few different settings
	of LC_MESSAGES.  Prompted by a report from Nelson Beebe.

2001-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Include the word `fail' in some diagnostics to make it clearer
	that they indicate a failure.
	* src/chgrp.c (main): s/getting attributes/failed to get attributes/.
	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode, main): Likewise.
	* src/chown-core.c (change_file_owner): Likewise.
	* src/chown.c (main): Likewise.
	* src/cp.c (re_protect): Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (touch, main):Likewise.
	Suggestion from Karl Berry.

2001-12-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dd.c (buggy_lseek_support): Remove function.
	(skip_via_lseek) [__linux__]: New function.
	(skip): Use skip_via_lseek, not buggy_lseek_support.
	Based on an outline from Paul Eggert.

2001-12-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Add Estonian (et).

2001-12-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.cfg (wget_files): Remove ansi2knr.c, since it's
	no longer available at that location.

2001-12-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/chgrp/basic: Don't use diff's -u option.  It's not portable.
	Besides, with GNU diff one can use the DIFF_OPTIONS envvar.
	* tests/ls/no-arg: Likewise.
	* tests/ls/recursive: Likewise.
	* tests/ls/rt-1: Likewise.

2001-12-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.3.

	* src/sys2.h (HELP_OPTION_DESCRIPTION): New macro.
	(VERSION_OPTION_DESCRIPTION): New macro.
	* src/chgrp.c, src/chmod.c, src/chown.c, src/cp.c, src/dd.c,
	* src/df.c, src/dircolors.c, src/du.c, src/install.c, src/ln.c,
	* src/ls.c, src/mkdir.c, src/mkfifo.c, src/mknod.c, src/mv.c, src/rm.c,
	* src/rmdir.c, src/shred.c, src/stat.c, src/sync.c, src/touch.c (usage):
	Use new macros, HELP_OPTION_DESCRIPTION and VERSION_OPTION_DESCRIPTION
	instead of hard-coding --help and --version descriptions.

	* POTFILES.in: Add src/sys2.h.

	* src/touch.c (touch): Extend the change of 2001-09-15 to work on
	systems for which errno is set to EPERM in that case.  Thus, e.g.,
	`touch /' by non-root gives a better diagnostic on systems like SunOS4.
	Reported by Volker Borchert.

	Don't emulate dd's skip=N for *all* character devices;  lseek works
	just fine on non-tape character devices like /dev/mem and /dev/kmem.
	* src/dd.c (buggy_lseek_support) [__linux__]: Emulate `skip=N'
	behavior using reads, not lseek for Linux tape devices (major == 9).
	Kernel lseek support for tapes is broken, up to and including
	linux-2.4.16.  Reported by Herbert Xu.

2001-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/ls/rt-1: Compare all lines of output.
	Update code to use `trap' and more up to date infrastructure.

	The change of 2001-11-01 introduced a bug whereby some recursive
	listings didn't have a blank line between per-directory groups of files.
	* src/ls.c (print_dir): Print a newline before each directory name
	except the first one, rather than after each except the last, since
	now (after the changes of 2001-11-01) detecting whether a `pending*'
	is the last would involve more work.  Reported by Andreas Schwab.
	* tests/ls/recursive: New file.  Test for the above.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add recursive.

	This change has no net effect.
	* src/ls.c (main): Remove always-true conjunct and add a comment.

2001-11-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/shred.c: Don't include "gtod.h"
	(main): Don't `call' GETTIMEOFDAY_INIT.
	* src/ls.c: Likewise.

2001-11-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint: Include signatures for the xdelta file, too.

	* Makefile.maint (emit-upload-commands): Rename from
	emit-rsync-commands.
	Output only the package name and the prev and current version numbers.

	* Version 4.1.2.

	* src/sync.c (usage): Make --help and --version strings
	start in column 7.

	* Makefile.cfg (move_if_change): Remove definition.

	* src/ls.c: Use XMALLOC and XREALLOC in a several places.  It's cleaner.

2001-11-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c: Include dirfd.h.

	(queue_directory): Remove just-added 3rd parameter

	(dev_ino_pop): New function.
	(ASSERT_MATCHING_DEV_INO): New macro.
	(visit_dir): Take two parameters (dev,ino), not one `pending'.
	(main): Initialized the dev_ino_obstack.
	Don't call visit_dir here.
	Get the dev/ino pair from the new stack, not from the pending entry.

	Make ls -R detect directory cycles.
	Add loop detection without incurring an additional stat call per
	directory processed.  To detect loops efficiently (i.e., time: +O(1)
	per directory processed by ls -R, total additional space:
	O(max-tree-depth)), record the dev/ino of each `active' directory
	in a hash table.  To know when a directory is no longer active,
	insert a marker (name == NULL) entry for it in the pending queue.
	When a marker comes to the front of the queue, that directory is no
	longer active, and must be removed from the hash table.  To remove it,
	we need to know its dev/ino again.  Since by the time a directory
	has become inactive its files[] info is long gone and it's DIR*
	is closed, I must either save the dev/ino someplace (pending seemed
	logical) or recompute them via stat.

	The following change will convert to using a stack of dev/ino pairs
	instead, pushing an entry when doing the opendir (use fstat on
	dirfd (reading)), and popping (when encountering a marker) to get
	the dev/ino pair to be removed from the hash table.

	* src/ls.c: Include hash.h, same.h, and xalloc.h.
	(INITIAL_TABLE_SIZE, LOOP_DETECT): Define.
	(active_dir_set): New global.
	(struct dev_ino): Declare.
	(dev_ino_hash, dev_ino_compare, dev_ino_free): New functions.
	(visit_dir, free_pending_ent): New functions.
	(main): Initialize the active_dir_set hash table, if necessary.
	Don't confuse a marker entry with a real one.
	Detect loops.
	Manage the set of active directories.
	Free the hash table.
	(queue_directory): Add a new parameter.
	Ensure that we set the new dev/ino members for each enqueued directory.
	Update all callers.
	(print_dir): Don't confuse a marker entry with a real one.
	(extract_dirs_from_files): Insert a marker entry before inserting
	the entries for subdirectories.

	Don't try to print a NULL pointer.
	* src/ls.c (main): Don't use ARGMATCH_TO_ARGUMENT.

	* src/dd.c: Remove as many instances of 'unsigned' as
	possible, as some of them were not conforming to ANSI C, and
	they made the code hard to read.  Avoiding 'unsigned' cuts
	down on the number of casts.

	(newline_character, space_character, save_char):
	Now char, not unsigned char.
	(obuf): Now char *, not unsigned char *.
	(ascii_to_ebcdic, ascii_to_ibm, ebcdic_to_ascii):

	Use int index, not unsigned int.
	(bit_count): Arg is now int, not unsigned int.

	it as a subscript.
	(swab_buffer): Returns char *, not unsigned char *.
	(dd_copy): Use char, not unsigned char, for buffers.

	read/write.  Use a stricter test for permissions.

	* tests/cp/link-preserve: Don't use a umask that removes owner
	read/write.  That would induce spurious failures in a probably-
	outdated version of purify.

2001-10-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/mv.c (movefile): Now that remember_copied xstrdup's the file

2001-10-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Now, -P is the same as --no-dereference, per POSIX.

	the hard-link-preserving code.

	Remove the link-preserving semantics from cp_options.dereference.
	Clean up the code that preserves links for `cp -d' and `mv'.
	Introduce new options:
	  --preserve[={mode,ownership,timestamps,links,all}]

	string for translation, since it contains the English word `and'.

	* Makefile.maint (author_mark_check): New rule.
	(local-check): Depend on it.

	Change the rules governing when mv prompts before removing an
	existing destination file so it is consistent with POSIX:
	Now, in the absence of --force (-f), if stdin is a tty and an
	existing destination is not writable mv will prompt before
	overwriting the destination file.
	Reported by Vin Shelton.

	* src/copy.c (overwrite_prompt): New function.
	(copy_internal): Separate the mv-specific and non-move_mode code
	that determines whether to prompt the user.

	the user declined to remove one or more of the files.

	* tests/mk-script ($program_name): Define.
	(main): Use $program_name, rather than long-inaccurate `build-script'.
	(main): Iterate over the sorted keys (rather than `while...each...'),
	so this script produces the same output regardless of which version
	of perl (e.g., perl5.6) is used.

	Work around non-compliant gettimeofday on Mac OS X 10.0.4,
	(aka Darwin 1.3.7) that caused the date of the first file listed
	in long output to be the current time rather than the file's mtime.
	The real work is in m4/gettimeofday.m4 and the wrapper function,
	lib/gettimeofday.c.
	* src/ls.c: Include gtod.h.
	(main): `Call' GETTIMEOFDAY_INIT.
	(print_long_format): Add a comment about gettimeofday.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Simplify previous patch for
	listing negative sizes, by adding OFF_T_MAX - OFF_T_MIN + 1
	instead of doing a fancy conditional shift.  This is simpler
	and it avoids GCC's bogus compile-time warning about shift
	counts.  (As a bonus, it is portable to hosts that do not use
	twos-complement arithmetic.  :-)

2001-08-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* ls.c (print_long_format): Multiply the shift width by zero
	to avoid a warning from gcc on hosts with an unsigned type for the
	st_size member.

2001-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): If a file size is negative, assume

	cases.

2001-05-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	because that would make `ls -RF dir' stat unnecessarily all of the
	files in dir/ on some systems.
	Similarly, don't set `format_needs_stat' for --dereference (-L),
	because that would make `ls -RLF dir' stat unnecessarily all non-symlink
	files in dir/ on some systems.
	Instead, ...
	(gobble_file): ... also stat a file if `trace_dirs' (-R) is set and its
	type is unknown.

	Separate the descriptions of -n and --numeric-uid-gid.
	Split string in --help output that had exceeded my limit of
	2048 bytes.

2001-04-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.1.

	* configure: Regenerate using a further-patched copy of autoconf-2.49e
	to work around a bug in its test for ranlib.  This is the change to

	* README: Don't mention mvdir.  It is no longer provided.
	Don't mention HP/UX vs. du blocksize problem.  It's long gone.
	Remove note about how cp, mv, and ln couldn't make backups
	of files with names of maximum length.  Now they can do that.

	for portability testing.
	Warn about and describe autoconf/automake version requirements.
	Use a better URL for the GNU Coding Standards.

	* man/rm.x: Refer to shred.

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Ensure that -1 has no effect when it
	follows -l, per POSIX.  Reported by Ulrich Drepper.

	* src/dd.c (usage): Mention that sync makes dd pad with spaces (rather
	than NULs) when used with block or unblock.
	(dd_copy): When using sync with either block or unblock,
	pad with spaces.  Reported by Dale Scheetz.

	argument.  Before, `mkdir d; ls no-dir d 2>/dev/null' would act like
	`ls d' and produce no output.  Now, it prints `d:'.
	Report and patch from Stéphane Chazelas.
	* tests/ls-2/tests: New tests, for the above fix.

2001-04-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	This test currently fails for mips-dec-ultrix4.4.

	* tests/install/create-leading: Use ../envvar-check rather than
	open-coding the same tests.

	* tests/envvar-check: Set/use $as_unset, for those shells
	(like Ultrix4's /bin/sh) that don't accept `unset'.

	* missing (--run): Use `eval' to run `"$@"'.  Otherwise, Ultrix4.4's
	/bin/sh fails and outputs garbage.

	* src/touch.c (usage): Tweak the obsolescent usage line so that
	help2man recognizes it as such.  Reported by Dan Jacobson.

2001-03-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (wget-update): Also get `missing'.
	Use for-loops.

	* missing: Update from automake.

2001-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* config.guess: Update from master repository.

	* Makefile.maint (my_distdir): Define new variable, and use this
	in place of most old uses of $(distdir).

	Reported by Akim Demaille.

	* tests/help-version: Ensure that /dev/full is a character device
	(using test -c) as well as being writable, before trying to write to it.
	Otherwise, the test could mistakenly append a newline to an existing,
	regular, writable, /dev/full file.
	Suggested by Ulrich Drepper.

2001-03-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dd.c (S_TYPEISSHM): Rename parameter to reflect its type.

2001-02-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Use jm_FUNC_MBRTOWC, not AC_CHECK_FUNCS(mbrtowc).

	* lib/mbswidth.c, lib/quotearg.c, src/ls.c (mbrtowc, mbsinit):
	Remove workaround macros for hosts that have mbrtowc but not
	mbstate_t, as we now insist on proper declarations for both
	before using mbrtowc.
	Reported by Matt Schalit.

2001-02-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* config.guess: Likewise.

2001-01-02  Volker Borchert  <bt@teknon.de>

	in the build directory, and update the source directory only when
	the merged catalog differs from the original.  This fixes the known
	`make distcheck' failure due to `make update-po' being called
	on up-to-date but read-only files.

2001-01-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	we have the top_level_* globals.  Remove the corresponding diagnostic
	from mv.c.
	Add a FIXME comment.

	a nonzero value after the buffer was reallocated.

2001-01-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Make ls -l compatible with POSIX, which requires that the
	behavior of time formats must depend only on LC_TIME, not on

	Report the year for files even slightly in the future.
	Avoid overflow problems near Y2038 on 32-bit hosts.

	* src/ls.c (gobble_file): Do not fall back on lstat if stat
	fails; POSIX.2 does not allow this.  Invoke acl only on
	non-symlinks, and only if lstat or stat succeeds.

2000-12-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure: Regenerate using the very latest version (in CVS) of

	safe_read, to avoid overflow e.g. on 64-bit Solaris sparc.
	(dd_copy): Remove unnecessary cast.

2000-12-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/fileutils.texi: Remove B suffix.  Document how to have
	the desired effect without it.

	* src/dd.c: Undo most of the changes since 2000-11-24, since we've
	documented a standard way to do it.
	(skip_bytes, seek_bytes): Remove.
	(usage): Remove B suffix.
	(scanargs, skip, dd_copy, main): Remove support for B suffix.

2000-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/mkdir.c (main): Remove any trailing slash unconditionally.
	Reported by Volker Borchert.
	* tests/mkdir/t-slash: Add a test for this.

2000-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0.33.

	* tests/touch/no-rights: Use touch with `-d tomorrow' to avoid a
	race condition.

	* tests/Fetish.pm (_compare_files): New function.

	* config.guess: Likewise.

2000-11-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dd.c (skip): Perform the `records < blocksize' test
	at the top of the loop, not at the bottom.

2000-11-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/dd.c (skip): New arg COUNT_BYTES.  Read with BLOCKSIZE
	bytes, but consider RECORDS to be a byte count if COUNT_BYTES
	is nonzero.

2000-11-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/fileutils.texi: Document seek=nB and skip=nB.

	* src/dd.c (skip_bytes, seek_bytes): Now booleans, not counts.
	(seek_records): Renamed from seek_record, for consistency with
	skip_records and max_records.  All uses changed.

	(usage, scanargs): Remove bseek=n and bskip=n; instead, use seek=nB
	and skip=nB.
	(enum Unit, Unit): Remove.
	(skip, dd_copy, main): Undo most recent change.
	(dd_copy, main): Pass blocksize of 1 as appropriate when

	(main): Rework ftruncate failure diagnostic to always use byte count.

2000-11-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dd.c: Add new options, bskip and bseek.
	Based on a patch from Chris Sylvain.
	* tests/dd/skip-seek: New tests.

	Reported by andras@kolumbus.fi at http://bugs.debian.org/77174.

2000-11-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/df.c (show_point): Before accepting an entry as a match, make
	sure that the mount directory exists and has the required device number.
	Before, e.g., `df /floppy' would mistakenly report on the root
	partition if /floppy were not listed in /etc/mtab but / was.
	Patch from Eirik Fuller (http://bugs.debian.org/76923).

	* src/chmod.c (mode_changed): New function.
	(change_file_mode): Use it to determine accurately when -c should
	make chmod announce there's been a change.

2000-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (BLOCK_SIZE_OPTION, COLOR_OPTION, FORMAT_OPTION,
	INDICATOR_STYLE_OPTION, QUOTING_STYLE_OPTION,
	SHOW_CONTROL_CHARS_OPTION, SORT_OPTION, TIME_OPTION): New enum
	values, to ensure that option values can't collide with chars.
	(long_options, decode_switches): Use them.

2000-11-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sys2.h (GETOPT_HELP_CHAR, GETOPT_VERSION_CHAR): Now enum
	constants rather than macros.  Use values that cannot conflict
	with C characters or with -1, CHAR_MAX + 1, etc.

2000-11-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/du.c (count_entry): Don't omit the size of a directory entry
	merely because we couldn't `chdir' into it.  That would give subtly
	different results in some cases.  Reported by Mattias Wadenstein
	via Michael Stone.

	* src/ls.c: Revert change of 2000-11-11.  It inadvertently change
	the output format of `ls -l --full-time'.

	* src/mkdir.c (main): When failing to create a directory, give only
	one diagnostic, not two.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* src/mkdir.c (main): With --parents, remove any trailing slashes
	from the argument to the final mkdir call.  Required for NetBSD.
	Reported by Volker Borchert.
	* tests/mkdir/t-slash: New test for this.
	* tests/mkdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add t-slash.

	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Create and `cd' into temporary directory
	before anything else.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* configure, config.h.in, Makefile.in, etc.: Regenerate using the
	very latest version (in CVS) of autoconf.

2000-11-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (.NOTPARALLEL): Remove target.
	* GNUmakefile (.NOTPARALLEL): ... put it here instead, since this
	file is common to these packages: fileutils, sh-utils, textutils.

	* Makefile.am (.NOTPARALLEL): New target.  Prevent unwanted parallelism.
	Suggestion from Ulrich Drepper.
	* po/Makefile.in.in (Makefile): Likewise.

	* Makefile.maint (sha1): Define.
	(announcement): Include SHA1 digest of .tar.gz file.

2000-11-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mkdir/perm: Add an `echo' so that the input to the sed command
	is NL-terminated.  Otherwise, Solaris' /bin/sed generates no output.
	Reported by Vin Shelton.

2000-11-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/sys2.h (ST_TIME_CMP_NS): Fix typo: ST_MTIM_NSEC should
	be tested with #ifdef, not with #if.

2000-11-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Remove obsolete comment.
	From Paul Eggert.

	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update from master repository.

2000-11-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@sic.twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (<langinfo.h>): Include if HAVE_LANGINFO_H.
	(DATE_FMT_LANGINFO): New macro, taken from sh-utils/src/date.c.
	(print_long_format): Use it to determine "date" format.
	Do not wrap "%b %e %Y" and "%b %e %H:%M" in _(), as it results in
	incorrect behavior when LC_ALL is unset, LC_TIME is "C", and
	LC_MESSAGES or LANG is set to something disagreeing with the POSIX
	locale.

2000-11-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0.32.

	* Makefile.maint (GZIP_ENV): Define to --no-name, so the timestamp
	is not included in the .tar.gz file.

	* tests/mkdir/perm (tests): Use `empty' (instead of just blanks) to
	indicate no `-m' option.  Using just blanks wasn't portable to
	Solaris2.5.1's /bin/sh.

	* tests/mkdir/perm: Don't put a newline in IFS;  that's not portable to
	NetBSD's /bin/sh.  Instead, filter newlines and leading/trailing blanks
	out of `tests' before the `set -'.

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Limit depth of ChangeLog `find' to 2.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Wrap the `--full-time' date format
	string in _(...), so it too may be internationalized.
	Suggestion from Jungshik Shin.

2000-11-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/touch.c (main): Interpret a lone numeric argument of 8 or 10
	digits as a file name, rather than as a date/time in the obsolescent
	`MMDDhhmm[YY]' format.  Reported by Wenjun Zheng.
	* tests/touch/obsolescent: New test for this.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add obsolescent.

2000-11-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Move mkdir tests into ../mkdir.

	* doc/fileutils.texi: Use Free Documentation Licence.
	Change GNU to @sc{gnu} in many places.

	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update from master repository.
	* config.sub: Likewise.
	* config.guess: Likewise.
	* man/help2man: Update from latest version: 1.23.

	* src/mkdir.c: Do not set the permissions of the final directory
	component if it was not just created.
	Based on a patch from Volker Borchert.

	* tests/rwx-to-mode: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add rwx-to-mode.
	* tests/mkdir/parents: New test for the above mkdir.c fix.
	* tests/mkdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add parents.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Define srcdir=$(srcdir).

2000-11-02  Won-kyu Park  <wkpark@chem.skku.ac.kr>

	* src/df.c (print_header): Mark strings for translation.

2000-11-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0.31.

	* configure, config.h.in, Makefile.in, etc.: Regenerate using the
	very latest version (in CVS) of autoconf.

	* src/mkdir.c (main): Use make_dir instead of using mkdir directly.
	Diagnose as failure when mkdir tries to create (without the
	--parent (-p) option) a directory that already exists.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Add a test for the above fix.

	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Clean up this test.

2000-11-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0.30.

	* src/chmod.c (main): Better diagnostics.

2000-10-31  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/lang-default: Add all the internationalization-related
	variable names autoconf uses.  Set and export them in a loop.

	`mkdir -p' would create parent directories with permissions
	that did not account for the umask. [introduced with the
	2000-09-30 change that became part of fileutils-4.0.28]
	* src/mkdir.c: Include dirname.h.
	Compute the parent directory `mode' unconditionally, effectively
	as `$(umask -S),u+wx'.
	Use make_path to create only the parent directories, thus using
	the same code, both with and without -p, to create the final
	component in each file name.  Reported by Bob Proulx.

	Add tests for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Add some permission tests.
	* tests/mkdir/perm: Fix the test so it actually does something.
	Run each test also with mkdir's `-p' option and check permissions
	on the parent directories.

2000-10-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/getdate.texi: Use @sc where appropriate.  Document the
	ranges of supported times more precisely.  Correct menu
	spacing.  Document old Latin 12m/12pm tradition.  Remove list
	of alphabetic time zone names, as it wasn't correct and people
	shouldn't be relying on it anyway.  Relative items also
	account for non-DST adjustments.  Fix some misspellings.

2000-10-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* configure, config.h.in, Makefile.in, etc.: Regenerate using the
	very latest version (in CVS) of autoconf.

2000-10-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0.29.

	* src/cp.c (do_copy): When constructing dst_path for use with the
	--parents option, first remove any trailing slashes from the command
	line argument.  Otherwise, tests/cp/cp-parent would fail on NetBSD.

	* tests/cp/cp-parents: Add a test.

	* src/ls.c (DT_INIT): Define.
	[enum filetype]: Remove the #ifdef, and use DT_INIT on the
	initializers instead.  `unknown' was undefined for some systems.
	Reported by John David Anglin.

	* tests/lang-default (LC_COLLATE): Set it to the empty string and
	export it.  Otherwise, tests/cp/cp-mv-backup would fail e.g., when
	LC_COLLATE was set to en.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

2000-10-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c (main): In call to gobble_file with `"."', use `directory'
	as the type, not `unknown'.
	[enum filetype] (arg_directory): Rather than `100', use
	a number that should never conflict with another DT_* value.
	From Ulrich Drepper.

	* Version 4.0.28.

	Make `ls' a lot more efficient on systems (e.g., linux-2.4.*)
	that store file type information in directory entries.

	* src/ls.c [enum filetype] (unknown):
	Add members (as yet unused):
	(HAVE_STRUCT_DIRENT_D_TYPE): Define.
	(format_needs_type): New global.
	(main): Set it.
	(print_dir): Set `type' from directory entry, if possible.
	(gobble_file): Add a parameter, TYPE.
	Stat the file only if its type is unknown and we need the type.
	Patch from Ulrich Drepper.

	Shred can now determine the size of a block devices (e.g. /dev/fd0)
	by writing until a write operation fails.

	* src/shred.c: Include assert.h.
	(fillrand): Add a parameter, size_max.
	Adjust caller.
	Add an assertion.
	(dopass): Break out of the `for (;;)' loop if size < offset.
	That can happen now that dopass is called with SIZE == -1.
	(do_wipefd): Accept a length of zero only for a regular file.
	If lseek fails or returns 0 for a non-regular file, let dopass
	determine the length.
	Inspired by a patch from Alan Iwi.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add lang-default.

	* tests/rm/hash: Factor out the expensive-test-checking code, ...
	* tests/expensive: ... into this new file.
	* tests/cp/perm: Disable this test by default; it's expensive.
	Mark this as an expensive test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add expensive.

	* doc/fileutils.texi (shred invocation): Give two examples.

2000-10-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

2000-10-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .prev-version.

2000-10-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cp.c (make_path_private): Add a FIXME comment.

	* tests/lang-default: New file.  Set LANG, LC_ALL, and LANGUAGE to ''
	(rather than to `C') and export them into the environment.
	Suggestion from Bruno Haible.

	* tests/cp/backup-is-src: Source lang-default rather than open-coding
	the setting/exporting of LANG, LC_ALL, and LANGUAGE.
	* tests/cp/cp-mv-backup: Likewise.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Likewise.
	* tests/cp/slink-2-slink: Likewise.

2000-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/cp-parents: New test.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cp-parents;

2000-10-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update from master repository.
	* config.sub: Likewise.
	* config.guess: Likewise.
	* depcomp: Likewise.

2000-10-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Make sure the programs use C-locale formats
	and translations.  Bruno Haible reported that this test would fail
	when using other locales, because ls printed a translation of `total'.

2000-10-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Wrap date format strings in _(...)
	so they may be internationalized.  Suggestion from Christian Rose.

2000-10-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): Remove FIXME-maybe comment.

2000-09-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/du/two-args: Update to use newer template.

	* src/install.c: Remove big, option-describing comment block.
	(main): Rename local `symbolic_mode' to `specified_mode'.

	* src/mkdir.c (main): Don't set the umask to 0 and hand-apply
	the previously-set umask unconditionally.  Do that only when a
	MODE has been specified.  Otherwise, call mkdir with the full
	creation mask (0777 or 0666) and let the kernel apply the umask.
	The difference shows up only on file systems with ACL support
	when the containing directory has a default ACL.
	Patch by Andreas Gruenbacher.
	(main): Rename local `symbolic_mode' to `specified_mode'.
	* src/mknod.c (main): Likewise (but `call mknod', not mkdir).
	Also, when MODE is specified, call chmod to ensure that the
	permission bits are set as specified even when the containing
	directory has a default ACL.
	Patch by Andreas Gruenbacher.
	* src/mkfifo.c (main): Likewise (but `call mkfifo', not mkdir).
	Patch by Andreas Gruenbacher.

	* tests/mkdir/perm: New test.
	* tests/mkdir/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add perm.

2000-08-17  Andreas Gruenbacher  <ag@bestbits.at>

	* src/chmod.c (change_file_mode): Perform the chmod even if the
	file mode permission bits are the same as those that should be set.
	Omitting the chmod call would be alright with minimal 1003.1e DS17
	ACLs, but eventually there may be other permissions in addition to
	rwx.  E.g., add and delete for directories, and something analogous
	to NT's take ownership permission.

2000-09-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Don't use `diff -u'.  It's not portable.
	Reported by Christian Krackowizer.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Run `diff -c' only if cmp finds a difference.
	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Likewise.  And clean up.

	`shred --exact file1 file2' wouldn't touch `file1'
	* src/shred.c (long_opts): --exact doesn't take an argument.
	Reported by Alan Iwi.
	* tests/shred/exact: New test for this.
	* tests/shred/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add exact.

	* Makefile.maint (PREV_VERSION): Get the value from a file, rather
	than trying to derive it from the current version number.
	This is much more robust.
	(alpha): Record just-released version number in `.prev-version',
	and commit (post-tag).

	* Version 4.0.27.

2000-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/fileutils.texi: Update to more closely match changes in 4.0z.

	* src/cp.c (main): Tweak a relatively new diagnostic.

2000-09-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/ls/time-1: Output more information when a test fails.

2000-09-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Once again make it so install always
	unlinks an existing destination before trying to open it for writing.
	Otherwise, installing onto a running shared library would make the
	running program malfunction.
	Reported by Dan Pascu via Michael Stone.

	* src/mv.c (do_move): Moving a directory specified with a trailing
	slash from one partition to another, and giving it a different
	name at the destination would cause mv to get a failed assertion.
	Reported by Michael Stone.
	(strip_trailing_slashes_2): Move function definition to precede
	new first use.
	* tests/mv/part-rename: New test for the above fix.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add part-rename.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't try to unlink directories when
	using --remove-dest with -R.
	* tests/cp/dir-rm-dest: New test for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add dir-rm-dest.

2000-09-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/fileutils.texi (cp invocation): Describe how --force works.
	Update description of -P (soon to change meaning to conform w/POSIX).
	Describe --remove-destination.

	* src/cp.c (main): When used with --force, each of the --link and
	--symbolic-link options now implies --remove-destination.
	Reported by Miles Bader via Mike Stone.
	* tests/cp/link: New file.  Test for the above fix.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Adjust for this change in behavior.

2000-09-15  Volker Borchert  <bt@teknon.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am (check-root, root-hint): New targets.
	(check-recursive): Depend on root-hint.
	* Makefile.am (check-root): New target.

2000-09-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/perm.texi (Changing Special Permissions): Remove this statement:
	``a' in the USERS part of a symbolic mode does not cause the special
	permissions to be affected'...  It doesn't reflect what the code does
	and isn't required by POSIX.  Reported by aldomel@ix.netcom.com via
	Mike Stone.

2000-09-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* config.sub: Update from master repository.

2000-09-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/cp-mv-backup (LC_ALL): Set to `C' and export to ensure
	that `ls' sorts the same way for everyone.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

	* Makefile.maint (b_host): Use freefriends.org, not tug.org.

2000-09-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Makefile.maint (announcement): Use a stricter regexp for the
	previous version.

	* Version 4.0z.

	* tests/cp/special-bits: New file.
	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add special-bits.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Propagate $MAKE into environment, for special-bits.

	* src/copy.c (SAME_OWNER, SAME_GROUP, SAME_OWNER_AND_GROUP): Define.
	(copy_internal): Avoid calling chown if we know it's not necessary.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Call chmod also if we've made the
	preceding chown call and we're supposed to preserve some special
	permission bit(s) that would have been reset by chown.
	Reported by Greg Louis.

2000-09-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/mkdir.c (S_IRWXUGO): Remove definition.
	* src/sys2.h (S_IRWXUGO): Define here, instead.

2000-09-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* doc/texinfo.tex: Update from master repository.
	* config.sub: Likewise.
	* config.guess: Likewise.

2000-09-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/part-symlink: Redirect stdout to stderr before trying to
	remove the temp directory.  Otherwise, the `rm -rf' would get an
	error because the output file wouldn't be closed and the directory
	wouldn't be `empty'.
	* tests/cp/same-file: Likewise.

	* tests/cp/same-file: Remove the `cp -dl sl1 sl2' case,
	since it's no longer portable (hard link to a symlink).
	Likewise for the `cp -bdl symlink foo' case.

	* config.guess: Update from master repository.

2000-09-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cp.c: Move declaractions of lstat, stat, and rpl_lstat
	as well as the definition of lstat from here...
	* src/copy.h: ...to here.
	* src/copy.c: Remove declaration of lstat, now that it's in copy.h.

	* tests/mv/force: mv's --force (-f) option is no longer needed for
	this test, now that all it does is cancel --interactive (-i).

	* tests/cp/same-file: Add new tests using cp's --rem option.
	Reflect the fact that cp's -f option no longer causes cp to remove the
	destination file before trying to open it.
	Reflect the fact that `cp -bdl' now makes a backup when copying a
	symlink onto the file it points to (FIXME: look into this, and why
	cp -bl does *not* do so).

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Tweak diagnostics.

2000-09-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Initialize new members.

	* src/cp.c (enum): Add UNLINK_DEST_BEFORE_OPENING.
	[long_options]: Add an entry for --remove-destination.
	(usage): Describe --remove-destination.
	(do_copy): Use unlink_dest_after_failed_open member, not `force.'
	(cp_option_init): Initialize new members.
	(main): Handle UNLINK_DEST_BEFORE_OPENING (aka --remove-destination).

	* src/mv.c: Remove obsolete comment block.
	(cp_option_init): Initialize new members.
	(usage): Reflect the fact that --force (-f) relates only to whether
	mv prompts.
	(main): Remove uses of old `force' option member.

	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Reflect

	`force' no longer means unlink-dest-before-opening
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options) [force]: Remove member.
	[unlink_dest_before_opening]: Add member.  `cp -f' and `mv -f' used to
	do this.  Now, you must use `cp --remove-destination' to get this
	behavior.  Now, `cp -f' and `mv -f' work as required by POSIX.
	[unlink_dest_after_failed_open]: Add member.
	Paul Eggert reported that `cp -f' removes an existing destination
	file unconditionally, and that is contrary to POSIX.

	* src/copy.c (same_file_ok): New function, extracted from copy_internal,
	and rewritten.
	(copy_internal): Unlink destination file when unlink_dest_before_opening
	option is set, and when the source is neither a regular file nor a
	directory.

	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add part-symlink.

	* src/ls.c: Use strcoll (not strcmp) when comparing file names.
	Suggestion from Ulrich Drepper.

2000-08-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): New parameters: X and NEW_DST.
	Remove the SPARSE_MODE parameter.  Update caller.
	Perform POSIX-mandated (for cp) open-with-O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC when copying
	a regular source file and the destination file exists;  upon failure,
	unlink that existing file, then open again, but with O_WRONLY|O_CREAT.
	(copy_internal): `force' is not related to interactive; remove
	the conjunct.
	Remove the entire `else if (x->force)' block;  justifying
	removal of the non-directory part is easy:  POSIX requires we try
	to open an existing regular file, so we can't unlink it beforehand.
	The part that changes the mode on a directory to allow overwriting
	isn't necessary.

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Rename two goto labels.
	(copy_internal): Set `new_dst' when the move_mode rename fails,
	since we then unlink the destination file.

	* src/cp.c (usage): --force is independent of --interactive.

2000-08-24  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Put back the kludge.  It's necessary after all.
	* src/dd.c (buggy_lseek_support): New function.
	(skip): Use it.
	Frank Adler reported that although _llseek returns 0, lseek
	erroneously returns an offset suggesting the operation succeeded
	even though it fails.

	* install-sh: Double quote as needed, to protect against arguments
	containing spaces or shell metacharacters.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

2000-08-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/dd/not-rewound: New test, for the SEEK_CUR vs. SEEK_SET part
	of the last change.  Based on Paul's example.
	* tests/dd/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add not-rewound.

2000-08-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/dd.c (skip):
	Assume lseek failed if it returned zero, since a zero return is
	impossible and some buggy drivers return zero.

	Use SEEK_CUR rather than SEEK_SET; this fixes a bug when the
	file descriptor is not currently rewound.

2000-08-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/dd.c: Back out my last change.  Paul's (above) is better.

2000-08-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Don't even try to use lseek on character devices.
	* src/dd.c (buggy_lseek_support): New function.
	(skip): Use it.
	Reported by Martin Gallant via Michael Stone.

2000-08-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/cp/same-file: Clean up traps.  Create files in a subdir.

	* install-sh (oIFS): Remove unmatched double quote, left over from
	my 2000-08-12 change.  From J. David Anglin.

	* Makefile.maint (wget-update): Get the latest version of depcomp.

	* depcomp: Update from automake.

2000-08-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0y.

	Add support for cp's new POSIX-mandated -H and -L options.
	* src/copy.h (enum Dereference_symlink): Define.
	(struct cp_options) [dereference]: Change type to Dereference_symlink.
	* src/copy.c: Declare lstat.
	(copy_dir): Set `xstat' member to lstat so that with `-H' we don't
	follow symlinks found via recursive traversal.
	Update uses of `dereference' to compare against new enum member names.
	* src/cp.c (long_opts): Add --dereference, -L.
	(usage): Describe -L and -H.
	(cp_option_init): Initialize to DEREF_UNDEFINED, not `1'.
	(main): Add `H' and `-L' to getopt spec string.
	[case 'a']: Initialize `dereference' to DEREF_NEVER, not 0.
	[case 'd']: Likewise.
	[case 'H']: New case.
	[case 'L']: New case.
	[case 'R']: Don't set dereference to `0' here.
	If it's not yet defined, set x.dereference to DEREF_NEVER
	if -R was specified, else set it to DEREF_ALWAYS.
	Set x.xstat accordingly for -H.
	* doc/fileutils.texi (cp invocation): Describe -H and -L.
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init): Initialize to DEREF_NEVER, not `0'.
	* src/install.c (cp_option_init): Initialize to DEREF_ALWAYS, not `1'.

	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add cp-HL.
	* tests/cp/cp-HL: New test.

	* src/du.c (print_totals): Rename global from opt_combined_arguments.

2000-08-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/copy.c (DO_CHOWN): Do not make a special case for non-root.
	POSIX.2 requires that cp -p and mv attempt to set the uid of the
	destination file, even if you're not root.  This affects behavior
	only on hosts that let you give files away via chmod.
	* NEWS: Describe the above change.

2000-08-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/du.c (count_entry): Remember the current directory also for `.'
	and `..'.  Reported by Stephen Smoogen, based on a patch from H.J. Lu.
	* tests/du/two-args: Add tests for this.

2000-08-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_reg): Move declaration of local, `n_read', into
	the scope where it's used.
	(copy_internal): In calling copy_reg, pass not the raw `src_mode',
	but the possibly-umask-relative mode, `get_dest_mode (x, src_mode)'.

2000-08-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (get_dest_mode): Rename from new_nondir_mode.
	Honor the umask for `cp', but not for `mv' or `cp -p'.
	(copy_reg): New 4th parameter, dst_mode.  Pass it as 3rd arg. to open.
	(copy_internal): Change type of locals `src_mode' and `src_type' from
	int to mode_t.
	Remove unnecessary local, `fix_mode'.
	Combine two if-stmts into one.
	Pass `src_mode' as 4th arg to copy_reg.
	If we've just created a new regular file, return early, skipping the
	chmod step.  copy_reg now sets permissions of such files upon creation.
	Use get_dest_mode, so there's just one chmod call here.

	* tests/cp/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add perm.
	* tests/cp/perm: New tests, to help ensure the above didn't
	change anything.

2000-08-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/into-self-2: Remove test for the VERSION_CONTROL and/or

2000-08-11  J. David Anglin  <dave@hiauly1.hia.nrc.ca>

	* install-sh: Improve error handling.
	Do the job even when the target file is `busy' on systems
	that don't allow such files to be unlinked.

2000-08-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* README: Remove note about how installation can fail and the
	work-around, now that it's all automated.

2000-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/shred.c (usage): Give a little more info.
	Remove a FIXME comment.

	Avoid warnings.
	* src/ls.c (struct bin_str): Declare `string' member to be `const'.
	(put_indicator): Declare local `p' to be `const'.

2000-07-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Begin converting "`%s'" in format strings to "%s", and wrap each
	corresponding argument in a `quote (...)' call -- if there's only one.
	If there are two or more, then use `quote_n (0, ...),
	quote_n (1, ...), ...'.

	Here's the justification, from Paul Eggert (thanks, Paul):

	  [Consider] the following, taken from fileutils/copy.c:

	     error (0, errno, _("cannot create directory `%s'"), dst_path);

	  Now, suppose dst_path is "/'\nrm: removing all files under `/"
	  (expressed in C string syntax).  This will cause the user to see
	  the following delightfully ambiguous display:

	    cp: cannot create directory `/'
	    rm: removing all files under `/'

	  It would be better to rewrite the above line to be something
	  like this:

	    error (0, errno, _("cannot create directory %s"), quote (dst_path));

	  using the definition of "quote" [in lib/quote.c].  That way,
	  the user will see the following unambiguous display instead:

	    cp: cannot create directory `/\'\nrm: removing all files under `/'

	  One might object that any user who asks to copy a file with
	  a weird name like that deserves to get confused.  But this
	  is not a good objection, as the source of the string may not
	  be under the user's control, or even visible to the user.

	* src/copy.c: Adapt format strings and args as above.  Include quote.h.
	I have deliberately not changed the output of --verbose.
	FIXME: maybe I should.
	* src/cp.c: Likewise.
	* src/remove.c: Likewise.
	* src/install.c: Likewise.  and improve a couple diagnostics.

2000-07-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

2000-06-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't return immediately after a failed

	Reported by Piotr and Maciej Kwapulinski.
	* tests/cp/fail-perm: Test for it.

	(usage): Don't call close_stdout here.
	(close_stdout_wrapper): New, kludgey, function and file-scoped global.
	(main): Register it with atexit.

2000-05-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Unlike for mv, -i doesn't cancel the effect of -f
	and -f doesn't cancel the effect of -i.
	* src/cp.c (main) ['f']: Don't reset `x.interactive'.
	['i']: Don't reset `x.force'.
	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Fix force and interactive tests.

2000-05-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (shred_LDADD): Add @LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME@.

	* src/rmdir.c (EEXIST): Remove now-unused definition.

	which is determined by the autoconf test in m4/rmdir-errno.m4.

2000-05-03  Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>

	Don't fail when running `make check' with non-`C' locale.

2000-05-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/install.c (change_attributes): Don't even attempt the chmod
	if the chown fails.  Before, when a non-root user ran `install -m 4755
	-o nobody FILE DEST', DEST would set-uid not to `nobody' but rather to

	* src/mkdir.c: Rename global: s/path_mode/create_parents/.

	(enum) [FROM_OPTION]: New member.

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add a few words of documentation of the above.

2000-04-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/cp.c (usage): Document that while the --backup option takes an
	optional argument, the -b option accepts none.
	(main): Use `backup type' in call to xget_version, not the
	now-deprecated `--version-control'.
	* src/install.c: Likewise.
	* src/ln.c: Likewise.
	* src/mv.c: Likewise.

2000-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

2000-03-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* po/Makefile.in.in (dist distdir): Don't use `ln' (which was just a
	space optimization anyway) to populate $(distdir).  Otherwise, the dist
	rules that change permissions would end up affecting the master sources.

	* src/df.c (show_point): Ignore shortcuts based on path
	prefixes that are loop file system mount points, since they

2000-02-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Remove `e' from getopt_long's list of
	option characters.  Reported by John Summerfield.

2000-02-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* Version 4.0q.

	* src/sys2.h: Guard declaration of strtoull also with
	`&& HAVE_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG'.

	* src/sys2.h: Use `#if !HAVE_DECL...' instead of `#ifndef HAVE_DECL...'
	now that autoconf always defines the HAVE_DECL_ symbols.

	Based on a patch from Adam Klein via Michael Stone.

	* tests/install/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add create-leading.

2000-02-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Transform the generated src/Makefile.in file so it falls back on
	using /bin/rm when necessary.  The old rule didn't always work.
	This is necessary only on certain losing systems, and because this
	package builds an `rm' executable and some people put `.' too
	early in their PATH.
	* Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Remove .deps and `FIXME' comment.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add .kludge-stamp.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/userspec.c.

	* doc/fileutils.texi (chown invocation): Deprecate use of `.'.

	* src/chown.c (usage): Mention only `:', and not `.' as the separator,
	since POSIX allows only the former.
	Prompted by a report from Manas Garg.

2000-02-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/df.c (main): Count the stat'able arguments.
	Print the header line only if there is at least one valid argument.
	Reported by Andy Longton <alongton@metamark.com>

2000-02-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	Make du work when invoked from an unreadable directory.

	* src/du.c (pop_dir): New function.

	function instead.
	Move declaration of global, `stat_buf' into this function.

	never returns with a changed working directory.

2000-02-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Use $null and $dir in place of literals
	in `here' script.
	Exit 77 if we can't set up the framework (Volker Borchert reported
	that this test would fail because mknod failed when run on SunOS4.1.4
	using NFS-mounted disk from an OpenBSD system).

2000-02-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't allow mv to move a directory onto

	From Michael Stone.

	* src/mv.c (main): Don't expect array index `n_files - 1' to evaluate

	memcmp memset mkdir rmdir rpmatch stpcpy strndup strstr strtol
	strtoul strverscmp.  Now they're in m4/.

2000-01-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@lucent.com>

	* tests/shred/remove: Make the warning that this shred test may not
	be run as root more prominent.  Suggestion from Volker Borchert.

2000-01-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix bug: `df PATH' sometimes misbehaves when there is an
	inaccessible mount point unrelated to PATH.
	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add realpath, resolvepath.
	* src/df.c (#pragma alloca): Add if _AIX is defined.
	(path-concat.h): Include.
	(show_point): If HAVE_REALPATH or HAVE_RESOLVEPATH is defined,
	find the real absolute path for PATH, and use that to find the
	mount point.

	(show_point): Prefer non-dummy entries in shortcuts, too.
	Disable bogus mount dirs instead of restatting them each time.

	1999-12-17  Kalle Olavi Niemitalo  <tosi@stekt.oulu.fi>

	* src/rmdir.c (remove_parents, main): Don't pass errno to error
	when printing "removing directory" message.  Failure of rmdir is
	handled elsewhere.

1999-12-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* configure.in: Remove clock_gettime tests.
	Now they're in m4/jm-macros.m4.

	* src/ln.c (usage): Correct typos.
	List new --target-directory=... usage.
	Reported by Göran Uddeborg

	* src/mv.c (usage): List new --target-directory=... usage.

1999-12-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/getdate.y (get_date): Fix typo in time_t overflow test.
	From Michael Stone.

1999-12-21  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* tests/shred/remove: Use $file, not $tmp/file.  Exit 77 if run as
	root.

1999-12-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/df.c (ceil_percent): Remove.
	(show_dev): Avoid overflow problems when calculating percent.
	Do not display negative percents.

1999-12-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Version 4.0l.

	* doc/fileutils.texi: Clarify and combine descriptions of -c and of
	--time=ctime.
	Likewise for -u/--time=atime.

	* src/ls.c [! LSTAT_FOLLOWS_SLASHED_SYMLINK]: Use lstat wrapper.
	[Notice the new configure-time test in m4/lstat-slash.m4. ]
	(main): Back out change from 1999-02-19 that made ls remove
	trailing slashes from command line arguments to accommodate early
	versions of Linux.  Now, `ls symlink-to-dir/' acts like
	`ls symlink-to-dir/.' thus following the symbolic link, as POSIX says
	it should.  Suggestion from Bruno Haible and Andreas Schwab.

	* lib/xstat.in (slash_aware_lstat): New function.
	(rpl_@xstat@): Use it.
	* lib/Makefile.am (lstat.c): Adapt rule to handle new parts of xstat.in.
	(lstat.c): Likewise.

	Make sure ls does the right thing with symlinks and trailing slashes.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add symlink-slash.
	* tests/ls/symlink-slash: New test, for above-fixed bug.

1999-12-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/shred.c (wipename): When repeatedly renaming a file, making the
	name shorter and shorter, skip to the next shorter length length if a
	rename fails (e.g. due to permission denied).  Otherwise, this loop
	would iterate for so long that shred would appear to be stuck in an
	infinite loop for any but the shortest file names.
	Reported by Joe Orton.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/shred/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add shred.
	* tests/shred: New directory
	* tests/shred/remove: New file.  Tests for the above-fixed bug.

1999-12-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Consistently use `error' to output
	the verbose, `created directory ...' messages.
	Reported by Bernhard Rosenkraenzer.

1999-12-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Move 120+ lines of stat.h-related macros from system.h (not shared)
	to sys2.h, which is shared between fileutils, sh-utils, textutils.
	* src/system.h: Move them from here...
	* src/sys2.h: ... to here.

	* src/system.h (S_IRUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, S_IWOTH): Define
	if not defined.  This was necessary on a NeXT Turbostation running
	Mach 3.3.  Reported by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): If -c or -u is specified and not -l
	(or any other option that implies -l), and no sort-type was specified,
	then sort by the ctime (-c) or atime (-u).  Part of this change reverts
	the 1998-01-10 delta.
	(usage): Update to reflect this change.
	Reported by Paul Slootman via Michael Stone.

1999-12-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/df.c (BLOCK_SIZE_OPTION, SYNC_OPTION, NO_SYNC_OPTION): Define
	these and use them instead of `CHAR_MAX + n'.
	* src/du.c (BLOCK_SIZE_OPTION, EXCLUDE_OPTION, MAX_DEPTH_OPTION):
	Likewise.
	* src/touch.c (TIME_OPTION): Likewise.
	* src/rmdir.c (IGNORE_FAIL_ON_NON_EMPTY_OPTION): Likewise.

	* tests/ls/time-1: Test more of the framework (touch's -a and -m
	options) before running the actual ls test.

1999-12-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/cp/cp-mv-backup: Use 1>&2 rather than `1<&-'.
	Suggestion from Volker Borchert.

1999-12-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Makefile.maint: Remove ftp.enst.fr.

1999-12-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Version 4.0k.

	* tests/mv/into-self-2: Adapt to reflect this change in behavior.
	Make sure the VERSION_CONTROL envvar is not set.
	Run diff if comparison fails.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): In move mode, if the rename attempt
	fails, then unlink any existing destination file.  This makes a
	cross-device `mv' more consistent with the intra-device behavior.
	This change is required by POSIX to make a cross-device move act with
	semantics similar to those of the rename syscall.  For example now
	`mv' can move a file onto a symlink to itself when that symlink
	is on a separate partition.  With fileutils-4.0j, it would fail with
	a diagnostic saying they were the same file.
	Reported by Bruno Haible.

	* tests/mv/to-symlink: New file.  Adds test for the above.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add to-symlink.

	* tests/cp/cp-mv-backup (trap): Be careful to close $actual before
	removing the containing directory.  Otherwise, on some systems rmdir
	fails to remove the containing directory.

	* tests/ls/time-1: List --full-time dates upon failure.

1999-12-02  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@suse.de>

	* src/ls.c (check_symlink_color): New variable.
	(main): Set it if we need to check for dangling symlinks when
	displaying colors.
	(gobble_file): Check check_symlink_color instead of print_with_color.

1999-11-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (usage): Shorten help for --show-control-chars.

1999-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Give the right diagnostic when failing to create a file in an
	unwritable directory.
	* src/touch.c (touch): Record errno upon failed errno and use that
	saved value if a subsequent fstat, stat or utime call fails.
	Reported by Wichert Akkerman via Michael Stone.

1999-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Clean up test scripts.
	* tests/mv/setup: Don't set/use DF or MKDIR.  Use df and mkdir instead.
	* tests/mv/mv-special-1: Likewise for these: LS MV MKDIR MKNOD RM TOUCH
	* tests/mv/backup-is-src: Likewise for RM and MV.
	* tests/mv/hard-link-1: Likewise.
	* tests/mv/into-self: Likewise.
	* tests/mv/into-self-3: Likewise.

	Add test for 1999-05-23 change to src/copy.c (copy_internal).
	* tests/mv/partition-perm: New file.
	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add partition-perm.

	* Version 4.0j.

1999-11-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/df.c (df_readable): Now returns char const *, not char *.
	New arg NEGATIVE.
	(ceil_percent): Now returns double, not int.
	Be more careful about adding 1 to a wild value.
	(show_dev): Don't filter out wild sizes from the underlying operating
	system; instead, show them to the user as faithfully as possible.

1999-11-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* doc/getdate.texi (Calendar date item): Correction regarding 0..68/
	69-99 split for 1900 vs 2000.  From Peter Moulder.

1999-11-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Add lstat.c and stat.c.

1999-11-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/rmdir.c (errno_rmdir_non_empty): New function to encapsulate
	errno comparison.
	(remove_parents): Use it.
	(main): Use it.

	* tests/cp/cp-mv-backup: Run `diff -c' if the test fails.

	* tests/ls/time-1: Use `ls' and `touch', not $LS and $TOUCH.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Specify PATH, etc.

	* src/chgrp.c: Declare lstat;  needed on e.g. SunOS4.
	Reported by Tom Tromey.

	* lib/strstr.c (strstr): Include config.h.
	Add a `;' between shloop label and `}'.
	From Akim Demaille.

1999-11-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/mkdir.c (S_IRWXUGO): Define if necessary.
	(main): Use chmod to set the permissions if bits other than those
	of S_IRWXUGO were requested.  Reported by Sami Farin.

1999-11-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* touch.c (touch): Simplify code a tad, using fd == -1 instead
	of separate valid_fd variable.

1999-11-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Don't fail just because we couldn't open
	an existing file.  This makes it so that touching a read-only
	file now works.  Also clean up and simplify.
	Based on a patch from Chip Salzenberg.
	* tests/touch/no-rights: New test for this.
	* tests/touch/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add no-rights.

1999-11-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/remove.c (print_nth_dir): Write one fewer byte so we don't print
	a trailing slash.
	(rm): Fix bugs in (and test, this time) the very rarely used code
	to warn about directory cycles.
	Reported by michael@roka.net.

1999-11-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Treat src and dest as the `same' in
	`mv src symlink-to-src' when src and dest are on different partitions.
	Otherwise, that `mv' command would silently remove `src'.
	Reported by Michael Stone.
	* tests/mv/into-self-2: Add a test for this fix.

	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Fix long-latent bug: s/&&/||/ (others
	just like that also dated back to 1992 were fixed in 1998-01-02).
	Richard Braakman reported that using `install -d -g foo 1/2`
	only sets the group on the intermediate directory, not the final
	component.  From Michael Stone.

1999-11-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@set.twinsun.com>

	* human.c (default_block_size): New function.
	(humblock): Use it if no block size is specified.
	(human_block_size): If the specified block size is zero, report an
	error if report_errors is nonzero; otherwise use the default.

1999-11-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/dircolors.hin: Add several more TERM types.
	Add .bz2 suffix.
	Add .png for real this time.
	Change the image types colors to be visible in a black-on-white xterm.
	From Michael Stone.

	* src/chgrp.c (xstat): New global.
	(main): Define it.
	(change_file_group): Use it.  Before this change, when running chgrp
	on a symlink without --dereference (-h) and when the requested group
	is the same as the group for the *symlink*, chgrp would do nothing.
	Now it changes the group of the file referenced through the symlink.
	Reported by Martin Mitchell.

	* src/chmod.c: Use REFERENCE_FILE_OPTION instead of bare `CHAR_MAX + 1'.
	* src/chown.c: Define and use REFERENCE_FILE_OPTION and

	is not portable.

	* tests/ln/misc: Use --b=simple, not the now-deprecated `-V simple'.
	* tests/ln/backup-1: Likewise.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/rmdir/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add rmdir.
	* tests/rmdir: New directory
	* tests/rmdir/ignore: New file.

	* src/rmdir.c (remove_parents): Use the correct test (just as in
	main) in handling --ignore-fail-on-non-empty.  From Michael Stone.
	(usage): Improve description of --parents.  Based on suggestion from
	Torsten Landschoff.

1999-11-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	Allow hard links to symlinks on systems that support it.
	* src/ln.c (STAT_LIKE_LINK): Define.
	(do_link): Use STAT_LIKE_LINK, rather than bare `stat', and perform
	the extra lstat only on systems where LINK_FOLLOWS_SYMLINKS.

	* src/ls.c (long_options): Correct typo (s/'F'/'p'/) so that `-p' is
	accepted as the short form of --file-type, per the documentation.
	From James Sneeringer.

	* src/ln.c (do_link): Fix typo (in which the function name `symlink'
	was tested instead of the variable `symbolic_link') that could make
	ln perform an unneeded `stat' call.

1999-11-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/system.h: Use HAVE_STRUCT_STAT_ST_BLOCKS, not deprecated
	HAVE_ST_BLOCKS.
	* src/copy.c: Likewise.
	* lib/fileblocks.c: Likewise.

	* configure.in: Move some type/header/member tests into
	m4/jm-macros.m4 (jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES) so they are shared by all of
	fileutils, textutils, and sh-utils.

1999-11-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* man/help2man: Import version 1.018.
	* man/Makefile.maint ($(man_MANS)): Remove use of --name=... option.
	* man/*.x: Include one-line summary in [NAME] section.
	* man/Makefile.summ: Remove the one-line summaries.

	* src/touch.c (full_write): Remove unused decl.
	(open_maybe_create): Remove.
	(touch): Don't record whether the file was created; this isn't
	possible to do reliably and portably without race conditions.
	If the file was created and if amtime_now is nonzero, this
	change means we'll have to do another utime system call, but
	that's no more harmful than the previous version of this code.
	Reported by Gabor Z. Papp.

1999-10-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

1999-06-01  Volker Borchert  <bt@teknon.de>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Make envvar-check depend on check-recursive rather
	than on `check' so that its tests are performed before any real tests.

1999-07-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/dd.c: Include getpagesize.h.
	(dd_copy): Page-align the input buffer.

	the above decl.

1999-06-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

1999-05-23  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/mv/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add force.
	(TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Change PATH to be absolute.

	* lib/getdate.y (get_date): Let mktime deduce tm_isdst if we
	have an absolute timestamp, or if the relative timestamp
	mentions days, months, or years.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* lib/human.c (human_readable): Allow from_block_size to be zero.

1999-05-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am (envvar-check): Renamed from check-local.
	(check): Depend on envvar-check so the envvar check is performed
	before all other tests.  Reported by Volker Borchert.
	* tests/.env-warn: Use `%%' place-holder that Makefile.am rule expects,
	so CDPATH is mentioned in the message.  Reported by Volker Borchert.

	* src/df.c (main): When asking for info on an explicit file name,
	just warn rather than failing if the table of mounted filesystems
	cannot be read.  Based on a patch from Mark Kettenis.

	* lib/version-etc.c (version_etc): Put version info and author names
	on the first two lines respectively rather than putting the three
	lines of copyright info between them.

	FILE is a directory.  Reported by Vin Shelton.

	* lib/human.c: Include <string.h> or <strings.h> for strlen prototype.

	* src/remove.c (pop_dir): Cast length to `int' to avoid a warning on
	64-bit systems.  From Ulrich Drepper.

1999-05-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/shred.c (main): Put `u' for -u in getopt_long's string argument.

	upper-case program names.  Add a definition of PATH.
	(TESTS): Add dir-1.

	* src/mkdir.c (main): Use better wording in diagnostic: `cannot
	create directory' rather than `cannot make directory'.  The former
	also matches the one in makepath.c.

	* src/dd.c (apply_translations): Use TOUPPER and TOLOWER,
	not toupper and tolower.

1999-05-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/makepath.c (make_dir): When reporting a mkdir failure and the
	target cannot be `stat'ed, use the errno from the failed mkdir call,
	not the one from the stat call.  Before this change, running
	`mkdir -p /no-dir/no-dir' as an unprivileged user would wrongly
	elicit `No such file or directory' instead of `Permission denied'.

	* lib/strtol.c (TYPE_SIGNED, TYPE_MAXIMUM, TYPE_MINIMUM): Define.
	(ULONG_LONG_MAX, LONG_LONG_MAX, LONG_LONG_MIN): Define if not defined.
	Based on a patch from Kaveh Ghazi.

	* src/ls.c (USE_ACL): Define this only #if
	(HAVE_SYS_ACL_H && HAVE_ACL && defined GETACLCNT).
	Use `USE_ACL' in place of `HAVE_ACL' everywhere else.  From Kaveh Ghazi.

1999-05-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/makepath.c: Include makepath.h libintl.h, not after it.
	Otherwise, we'd get the wrong definition of PARAMS from libintl.h.
	(The method of defining PARAMS in libintl.h doesn't check PROTOTYPES,
	which is necessary on Irix4 since cc doesn't define __STDC__.)
	From Kaveh Ghazi.

1999-04-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Makefile.maint: Define several tag-related make variables.
	(cvs-dist): Use the make variables instead of shell ones.
	(announcement): Automatically generate diffs for all ChangeLog files,
	not just the top level one.

1999-04-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/dup2.c: New file.

1999-04-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/touch.c (touch): Only do the fstat if we need to.
	Resort to calling stat for directories, but only when necessary.
	(usage): Mention --no-create.

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Move the one-file-system test so that
	it follows the `if (new_dst || !S_ISDIR (dst_sb.st_mode))' block.
	Prior to this change, `cp --one-file-system' would traverse a file-
	system boundary if the destination directory existed.  From Ton Hospel.

1999-04-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/dd.c: Always use STDIN_FILENO for input and STDOUT_FILENO
	for output, to avoid confusion with closed input and output fds.
	(input_fd, output_fd): Remove; all uses changed to STDIN_FILENO
	and STDOUT_FILENO.
	(open_fd): New function.
	(main): Use it, instead of open, to ensure that file descriptors
	don't get confused.

1999-04-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches): Use STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO instead
	of 0, 1.

	* src/dd.c (skip): Don't fstat the input file; the result is
	no longer used.

1999-04-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/mv/into-self-2: Update to reflect this change by reversing
	the order of arguments so the symlink is the source, not the
	destination (otherwise, the mv command would now succeed).

	* src/copy.c (copy_internal): Don't make `mv foo symlink-to-foo' fail.
	That is, even though source and destination are `the same,' don't fail
	if the destination is a symlink.  From Peter Samuelson.

1999-04-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* src/dd.c (main): If you can't open an output file (with
	seek=...) read-write, then open it for write and report an
	error if we can't seek.

	* lib/filemode.c (setst, ftypelet, mode_string):
	* lib/mkdir.c (mkdir):
	* lib/makepath.c (make_path):

	* lib/modechange.h (mode_adjust):
	* src/chmod.c (describe_change, change_file_mode):
	* src/copy.c (copy_reg, copy_internal):
	* src/copy.h (struct cp_options.umask_kill):
	* src/cp.c (do_copy, cp_option_init, main):

	* src/mkdir.c (main):
	* src/mkfifo.c (main):
	* src/mknod.c (main):
	* src/mv.c (cp_option_init):
	* src/touch.c (open_maybe_create):
	Use proper mode_t types and macros.
	Don't assume the traditional Unix values for mode bits.

	* lib/filemode.c (S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP, S_IROTH, S_IWOTH,
	S_IXOTH): Define if not defined.
	(rwx): Remove.
	* lib/mkdir.c (S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, S_IRWXO): Define if not defined.
	* lib/makepath.c (S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX, S_IRUSR, S_IRWXU):

	Define if not defined.
	(CHMOD_MODE_BITS): New macro.
	* src/install.c (isodigit): Remove unused macro.

	* src/mkfifo.c, src/mknod.c (usage):
	Use symbolic mode as default, not octal.

	* lib/utime.c (utime_null):
	Don't pass 0666 to open; it's not needed and isn't
	guaranteed to be portable.

	* lib/filemode.h: <config.h>, <sys/types.h>: Include for mode_t.
	(mode_string): Now takes mode_t.

	* lib/modechange.h: Include <config.h>, <sys/types.h> for mode_t.
	(struct mode_change): Members affected and value are now mode_t instead
	of unsigned short.

	* doc/fileutils.texi, doc/perm.texi:
	Don't assume traditional Unix mode numbering.

	* lib/modechange.c: modechange.h now includes sys/types.h.
	Include xstrtol.h.
	(isodigit, oatoi): Remove.
	(S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX, S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP,
	S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP, S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH, S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG,
	S_IRWXO): Define if not defined.
	(CHMOD_MODE_BITS): New macro.
	(mode_compile): Convert from octal with xstrtoul, not our own routine.

	* Version 4.0g.

1999-04-22  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/shred.c (word32): Don't use `#error'; it runs afoul of
	SunOS 4.1.4 cc.  From Paul Eggert.

	* lib/strtoull.c: Guard strong_alias and weak_alias with #ifdef _LIBC.

1999-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Replace our temporary hack implementation of strtoumax with
	something very close to the real code in glibc.

	* lib/xstrtoumax.c: Remove the temporary strtoumax replacement;
	we now have a true replacement in strtoumax.c.
	(__strtol): Always define to strtoumax.
	(<stdlib.h>): No need to include.
	(PARAMS): Remove.
	(my_strtoumax): Move this to strtoumax.c,
	rename it to strtoumax, and simplify.

	* lib/strtoull.c, lib/strtoumax.c: New files.

	* lib/strtol.c: Update to glibc 2.1.1 version.

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): s/posix-warn/env-warn/.
	(check-local): Also test and warn if CDPATH is set.

1999-04-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CANONICAL_HOST): Add; needed for new AC_LFS's
	cross-compilation.
	* config.guess: New file (from autoconf).
	* config.sub: New file (from autoconf).

	* src/shred.c <config.h>: Include first, since it can do
	things like #define const, and this must be done before
	including any system headers.

	* lib/xstrtoumax.c (my_strtoumax): Fix typo in computing
	whether overflow occurred.  Improve overflow-detection to use
	only one conditional branch total, rather than 2N+1
	conditional branches for an N-digit number.

1999-04-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove strtoull, strtoumax, and
	strtouq, now that they're checked in m4/xstrtoumax.m4.

1999-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* doc/fileutils.texi, src/shred.c (main, longopts):
	Use -u instead of -R for --remove, so that we can preserve
	future compatibility with rm.

1999-04-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/shred.c [!HAVE_CONFIG_H] (ST_BLKSIZE): Define to 65536.
	(do_wipefd): Use ST_BLKSIZE instead of referring to the st_blksize
	member directly.

1999-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Fix shred to do the right thing with off_t longer than long.
	Merge large-integer parsing code with similar code in dd.c,
	and put the resulting in lib/xstrtoumax.c so that other programs
	can use it.  Instead of adding a new lib/xstrtoumax.h I thought
	it cleaner to put all the xstroto* declarations into a single
	header, which for now is lib/xstrtol.h for lack of a better place.
	(Mayby lib/xstdlib.h would be better?  :-)

	I thought of several other problems with shredding regular files;
	shredding devices is much more reliable.  So I changed the defaults
	to be more suitable for shredding devices; this should help encourage
	users to do the right thing.

	pfstatus isn't portable to environments with varying width
	fonts, or with internationalized environments where the byte
	count of the message is not the same as its print width.
	Rather than deal with this, I just simplified it to not do
	tricks with carriage-returns and spaces.  (I'm also worried
	that vprintf may not return the right value on some hosts; I
	vaguelly recall this being a problem.)  As a result, -v and -
	no longer conflict.

	When removing a special file, try to truncate it first, but don't
	worry if this reports an error.

	Try to find the size of a non-regular file by seeking to its end.

	Various porting fixes, mostly because of a port to SunOS 4.1.4 cc.

	Some other minor bug fixes.

	* lib/xstrtoul.h: Remove this file.
	* lib/xstrtoumax.c: New file.

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add strtoull, strtoumax, strtouq.

	* lib/xstrtoul.c (STRING_TO_UNSIGNED): Remove.
	(__strtol, __strtol_t, __xstrtol): New macros.

	* lib/xstrtol.c (__strtol, __strtol_t, __xstrtol):
	New macros to specify the
	underlying function, its returned type, and our function.  Default to
	values suitable for xstrtol.

	Include <ctype.h>, since we use its macros.

	(ULONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ISBLANK): Remove: no longer needed.
	(ISSPACE): New macro.

	(bkm_scale, bkm_scale_by_power, __xstrtol, main): __unsigned long int
	-> __strtol_t.

	(__xstrtol): Depend on whether __strtol_t is an unsigned type, not on
	whether STRING_TO_UNSIGNED is defined.  Skip isspace chars, not
	isblank chars, to match strtol.  When returning
	LONGINT_INVALID_SUFFIX_CHAR, store the value that we computed into
	*val.

	* lib/xstrtol.h (__xstrtol, __strtol, __unsigned): Remove macro decls.
	<inttypes.h>: Include if HAVE_INTTYPES_H.
	(_DECLARE_XSTRTOL): New macro.
	(xstrtol, xstrtoul, xstrtoumax): Declare all three functions, so that
	we need only one include file, not three.
	(_STRTOL_ERROR): Do not undef, as this is no longer needed.
	Reword overflow message so that it's independent of type.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libfu_a_SOURCES): Add xstrtoumax.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Remove xstrtoul.h.

	* lib/xmalloc.c (xalloc_fail):
	Pass xalloc_msg_memory_exhausted through gettext.

	* lib/getdate.y:
	<stdlib.h>: Include if HAVE_STDLIB_H, since bison 1.27 invokes "free".
	(LookupWord, yylex): Don't pass negative char to ctype macros.

	* doc/fileutils.texi:
	Explain why shredding devices is more reliable, and why the
	default options are more suitable for devices.

	Remove withdrawn options -b or --no-contents, -c or --freed-contents,
	-C or --all-contents, -k or --no-links, -l or --ordinary-links, -L or
	--all-links.

	Add -R or --remove, -s or --size.

	-v can no longer be doubled.

	`file system' --> `filesystem' uniformly.

	* src/chgrp.c: Include xstrtol.h, not obsolete file xstrtoul.h.

	* src/shred.c: Include xstrtol.h, not obsolete file xstrtoul.h.
	"human.h", "xalloc.h": Include.
	(attribute): Remove; no longer needed.
	(xstrdup): New decl.
	(STDOUT_FILENO): New macro.
	(O_NOCTTY): Make sure it's always defined, even if HAVE_CONFIG_H.

	The following changes have effect only if !HAVE_CONFIG_H.
	<ctype.h>: New include.
	(RETSIGTYPE): Remove bogus semicolon at end.
	(STDOUT_FILENO, uintmax_t, human_readable, LONGEST_HUMAN_READABLE):
	New macros.
	(xstrtoumax): Renamed from xstrtoul, with corresponding type changes.
	Handle suffixes like the real routine does.
	(error): Remove bogus assignment of errno to errnum.
	(xmalloc, xstrdup): New functions.

	(O_NOCTTY): Define even if !HAVE_CONFIG_H.
	(S_ISFIFO, S_ISSOCK): New macros, if not already defined.
	(OUTPUT_BLOCK_SIZE): New macro.
	(struct Options.verbose): Now a boolean, since we no longer have two
	levels of verbosity.
	(long_opts, usage, main): Remove -D or --device option.  Invert -p or
	--preserve option, and rename it to -R or --remove.
	(usage): Describe G suffix.
	(usage): "-" no longer conflicts with -v.
	(UCHAR_MAX): Indent `#error' so that SunOS 4.1.4 cc doesn't reject it.
	(ind): Portability fixes: return word32, not unsigned; multiply by
	sizeof (word32) instead of shifting left by 2.
	(isaac_refill, isaac_mix): Comment out size of array parameter, as
	ansi2knr mishandles this.
	(status_visible, status_pos, pfstatus, flushstatus): Remove, since
	pfstatus isn't portable to users with varying width fonts, or
	internationalized messages, and vfprintf is problematic.  All callers
	of pfstatus changed to use error instead; this removes incompatibility
	of -v with -.  All calls to flushstatus removed.
	(dopass, do_wipefd): Do not translate non-English msgs with gettext.

	(dopass): Cast lseek constant arguments to (off_t) for benefit
	of pre-ANSI compilers; fix one lseek call whose args were interchanged.
	Remove unnecessary casts to (off_t).  Do not check for EIO
	when determining file size; this was just my earlier wild guess.
	Use human_readable to print off_t, instead of casting to unsigned long
	(which doesn't work in Solaris 2.6, where off_t is longer than long).
	Output human-readable sizes, instead of always using "K".
	Check for offset overflow (it happened to me in SunOS 4.1.4).
	(do_wipefd): Do not insist on regular files, but do check for special
	files that cannot possibly be shredded.
	Use xmalloc instead of malloc + check.
	Do not inspect st_size for non-regular files.
	Try to find the size of a non-regular file by seeking to its end.
	Do not assume that a regular file of size-0 has unknown size.
	Check for regular files with negative sizes,
	and for overflow after rounding to next block.
	Always try to truncate, even for special files, but do not report an
	error if truncation fails on a special file.

	(dopass, wipefile): Do not return 1 for special files; the caller
	doesn't care any more.

	(wipefd): Remove unnecessary (and nonportable) check for
	whether the file descriptor is read-only.  Remove
	no-longer-needed check for `-v -'.

	(incname): Return 1 for carry bit, like the documentation says.

	(wipename, wipefile): Accept new argument, specifying the
	quoted file name.  All callers changed.

	(wipename): Use xstrdup instead of strdup+error check.

	(wipefile): Check for ENOTDIR when opening /dev/fd/NNN. Check for
	errors in NNN more carefully. Restore errno after the check.
	Check for errors when closing the file descriptor.
	Use more consistent wording when unable to remove a file.

	(main): Do not remove files by default.
	Use xstrtoumax instead of xstrtoul uniformly, since xstrtoul won't
	exist if !HAVE_CONFIG_H.
	In diagnostics, quote invalid operands to -n and -s options.
	Allow T, P, E, Z, and Y suffixes in -s operand.
	flags.verbose is now a boolean, not a counter.
	Use STDOUT_FILENO instead of 1, for clarity.

	* lib/human.c:
	Include xstrtol.h, not xstrtoul.h, since xstrtol.h now defines all the
	xstrto... functions.

	* src/dd.c: Include xstrtol.h.
	(parse_integer): Migrate most of the work into the new xstrtoumax fn.

	* lib/xstrtoumax.c: New file.

1999-04-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/dd.c (main): Open the output file with *read* access
	only if we might need to read to satisfy a `seek=' request.
	From Matthias Urlichs.

1999-04-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Makefile.maint (alpha): Add trailing slash for ncftp.

	* Version 4.0f.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/dd/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add dd.
	* tests/dd: New directory
	* tests/dd/misc: New file.

	`ls --color' would segfault
	* src/ls.c: Include assert.h.
	(color_indicator[]): Add an entry for the type, `door.'
	(main): Assert that the lengths of the color_indicator and
	indicator_name arrays are appropriately related.
	Reported by John Gotts.

	* src/dd.c (scanargs): Fix bug introduced with last change: now that
	the loop is gone, manually decrement argc and increment argv.
	Reported by Andreas Jaeger and jvogel@linkny.com.

1999-04-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/getdate.y (difftm): Protoize.

1999-04-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* lib/strftime.c: Update from master source in libc.

1999-04-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* tests/ln/misc: Comment out the test added on 1999-01-31.

	* Makefile.maint (url_dir_list): Define properly.
	(real_dir_list): Likewise.

	* src/shred.c: Don't include string.h.
	[!HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Include string.h here.
	[!HAVE_CONFIG_H]: Hard-code RETSIGTYPE to `int'.
	(sigill_handler): Change return type and type of local `oldhandler' to
	RETSIGTYPE.
	(isaac_seed_machdep): Change and type of local `oldhandler' to
	RETSIGTYPE.
	From Colin Plumb.

	* Version 4.0e

	* tests/cp/same-file: Change the sed command used to extract the
	filename from ls -l output, to accommodate the change in format.

	* src/ls.c (print_long_format): Add a space between %s and %3u.  This
	assures that even when modebuf has the trailing `+' and there are more
	than 99 hard links to a file, the permissions string and the link count
	will be separated.

1999-04-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* src/shred.c (dopass): add curly braces to avoid warning about
	ambiguous `else'.
	(wipefd): Add parentheses suggested by gcc.
	(do_wipefd): Remove declaration of unused local.

1999-04-02  Colin Plumb  <colin@nyx.net>

	* shred.c [!HAVE_CONFIG_H] (xstrtoul, error, close_stdout): Added stubs
	to allow standalone compilation.

	(wipefile): Added support for emulating /dev/fd/# files even if
	the OS doesn't support them.  From Paul Eggert.

	(main, usage): Changed --device short option to -D.

	(wipefd, do_wipefd): Renamed function to do_wipefd and added
	separate wipefd that performs sanity checks on externally-opened file
	descriptors, such as not append-only.  From Paul Eggert.

	(do_wipefd, isaac_seedfd): Do not read file for any reason.
	if the file is low-entropy, it's a security hole.
	(wipefile) Changed to open O_WRONLY and chmod to write-only when
	forcing.
	(isaac_seedfd) Function deleted as unnecessary.
	From Paul Eggert.

	(dopass): Dynamically fall back to fsync() if fdatasync() fails,
	since POSIX, in their infinitesimal wisdom, encourage implementations
	that return constant -1, making compile-time testing useless.
	From Paul Eggert.

	(dopass): Changed to support a size of -1 to mean "unknown".
	This entailed changing to a counting-up offset rather than couting-down
	cursize for the central state variable.  Also changed size argument to
	be call-by-reference so that it can be passed back once known.
	(sizer) Function deleted as unnecessary.
	(wipefd): Changed to match.  From Paul Eggert

	(dopass): Try to skip over bad blocks in destination files.
	Also added ftruncate() for more complete destruction of metadata.

	(main, usage): Changed "-" to stand for standard output.
	(wipefd): Added error message to detect conflict with -v.

	(dopass): Added periodic fsync() calls to keep the pass progress
	display in sync with reality.  Hopefully they're sufficiently far spaced
	that throughput isn't affected.  It might be a good thing to do even in
	non-verbose mode, to avoid filling up the kernel caches with dirty data.
	Also added ftruncate() for more complete destruction of metadata.

	(quotearg_colon): New function to print
	pathological filenames properly.
	[!HAVE_CONFIG_H] (quotearg_colon_buf) New internal helper function
	that does most of the work.
	(wipefd, do_wipefd, dopass) Now take a qname (pre-quoted name) argument.
	(wipename, wipefile, main) Changed diagnostics to use quotearg_colon.
	Error messages are also in a more uniform format.
	From Paul Eggert.

	(struct Options, main, do_wipefd): Added -s/--size=N flag.
	(xstrtoul): Added support for valid_suffixes to help this.
	(usage) Documented it.

	(error): Changed some arguments from N_() to _(), since error()
	does not translate its argument.  I think this is a bug.

	(struct Options do_wipefd, wipefd, wipefile, main): moved passes
	argument into the Options structure as n_iterations, which is now a
	size_t.  From Paul Eggert.

	(isaac_seed_start, isaac_seed_data, isaac_seed_finish): New functions
	to manage seeding of RNG with arbitrary-sized data.
	(isaac_init): commented out as dead code.
	(isaac_seed): changed to use new functions to prevent any possibility of
	a buffer overflow.

	(isaac_seed): Added support for Solaris' gethrtime()
	configure.in: Corresponding feature test.  From Paul Eggert.

	(wipename): Change remove() to unlink() for speed & portability.
	Use lstat() instead of access() to see if a filename is taken.  This
	works even on dangling symlinks and avoids the suid problems of
	access(2).  From Paul Eggert.

	(isaac_seed_machdep): New function for reading cycle counters

1999-04-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@shade.twinsun.com>

	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add gethrtime.

	* src/shred.c (isaac_seed): Don't overrun the s->mm buffer.
	Use gethrtime if available.  Don't assume that clock_gettime succeeds.
	Put most random sources first.

1999-04-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	shred: Add new options -bcCklL and fix some porting problems.
	Remove options -dp.  Do not read output files.

	* src/shred.c (long_opts, usage, main, wipefile): Adjust to
	new options.
	("human.h", "quotearg.h"): New includes.
	(struct Options): New members contents, links, n_iterations.
	Remove allow_devices, remove_file.  Change n_iterations to size_t.
	All uses changed.
	(output_block_size): New var.
	(usage): Declare __noreturn__ attribute.
	(fdatasync): Define to -1 if not present, since we need to invoke both
	fdatasync and fsync if both are present.  All invokers of fdatasync
	now try fdatasync, then fsync.
	(MIXIN): New macro.
	(isaac_seed): Use it to mix in values.  Add uid, gid to mix.
	Don't use gettimeofday, as it has too many porting problems.
	(isaac_seedfd): Remove, since we no longer read the output files.
	(sizefd): Remove; we now determine size by writing sequentially.
	(dopass, wipename, wipefile, main): Clean up error messages.
	(dopass): Keep track of offset relative to start of file, not
	end, since we may not know how large the file is.  If size is
	negative, write until we fall off the end of the file.
	(wipefd): Do not read output file.
	Return 0 if successful, -1 if not; do not make a special case for
	non-regular files, since our callers have that info now.
	(wipename): Now static.  Return errno if error.
	(main): "-" now stands for standard output.
	Do not shred append-only standard output.
	(wipefile): Do not grant read permission to file when wiping it.
	Use symbolic permission (S_IWUSR), not octal.

	* src/system.h (S_IWUSR): Define if not already defined.

	* configure.in (AC_SEARCH_LIBS): Prefer rt to posix4, for Solaris 7.
	(AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Remove gettimeofday.

	(gobble_file): Initialize it.
	(print_long_format): Use it.
	Mostly from Alen Muzinic.

	* src/touch.c (open_maybe_create): New function.
	(touch): Rewrite not to use `creat' and to eliminate a race
	condition that could make touch truncate a nonempty file.

	Now, they're included via sys2.h.

1999-03-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* configure.in (GNU_PACKAGE): Remove related code -- now it's in
	the catch-all for shared autoconf code, m4/jm-macros.m4.
	(jm_CHECK_ALL_TYPES): Remove explicit AC_TYPE_* macros and use
	this instead.

1999-03-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Minor lint removal in code that forks and execs.

	* lib/mkdir.c (mkdir): Use pid_t instead of int; check status
	against zero.  This is to improve portability.
	* lib/rename.c (rename): Likewise.
	* lib/rmdir.c (rmdir): Likewise.

	* lib/rename.c (rename):
	(rename): Do not print any error messages, so that the messages

	Check for strip nonzero exit status.

1999-03-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	`chmod =OP' did not properly apply the umask
	* lib/modechange.c (make_node_op_equals): New function.
	(mode_append_entry): Likewise.
	(mode_compile): When none of [ugoa] is specified in an `=OP' change
	mode request, insert a `=0' entry into the linked list so that all
	bits are cleared first.  Use the new functions.
	Reported by Andrew Dalke.

	New test for the above.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/chmod/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add chmod.

1998-11-07  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Version 4.0-b7.

	Accommodate the Hurd (defining lstat to rpl_lstat via config.h didn't

	`rm -r ''' got a failed assertion on the Hurd.  This change
	doesn't fix *that* problem -- see above.

1998-10-25  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* Version 4.0-b6.

	* README: Man pages will now be supported to the extent that
	people send patches.

	* tests/rm/unreadable: Two new tests.

	it out since we're so close to release and since the test compares the
	text of diagnostics that are likely to vary between systems.
	(TEST_ENVIRONMENT): Add required framework.

	* src/remove.c (remove_cwd_entries): Don't apply CLOSEDIR to a NULL
	pointer. (provoke with `mkdir -m 0100 x; rm -rf x')

	Don't invoke localtime_r or gmtime_r unless it's the GNU C
	library's localtime_r and gmtime_r; there are too many buggy
	implementations of localtime_r and gmtime_r out there, and
	it's not worth keeping track of all the different bugs.

	* mktime.c (__EXTENSIONS__, HAVE_LOCALTIME_R): Remove.
	(my_mktime_localtime_r): Renamed from localtime_r; all uses changed.
	Base it on localtime unless _LIBC.

	(my_strftime_gmtime_r): Renamed from gmtime_r; all uses changed.
	(my_strftime_localtime_r): Renamed from localtime_r; all uses changed.

	* mktime.c (__mktime_internal): When the requested time falls

	away from the requested time, preferring a time whose tm_isdst
	differs from the requested value.  Bump the max number of
	probes from 4 to 6 to account for the extra probes needed to
	discover a spring-forward gap in the worst case.

1998-10-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* mktime.c (my_mktime_localtime_r): Renamed from localtime_r.
	Define also if HAVE_LOCALTIME_R && defined (localtime_r), with
	a body that merely expands localtime_r; this works around a
	bug in Digital Unix 4.0A and 4.0D.

1998-10-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@ascend.com>

	* po/Makefile.in.in (uninstall): Remove (historical?) command that

	(main): Pass options (`&x') to rm.
	Call remove_init and remove_fini instead of open-coding them.

	* src/mv.c (rm_option_init): New function.
	(cp_option_init): New function.
	(copy_reg): Remove now-unused function.
	(do_move): Set up for and use `copy.c (copy)' in place of copy_reg.
	Set up for and use `remove.c (rm)' in place of unlink.

1998-01-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/backupfile.c: Use ANSI function definitions.
	Remove global declaration of backup_type.
	(simple_backup_suffix): Default to `~', not `.orig'.
	Use PARAMS, not __BACKUPFILE_P.
	(find_backup_file_name): Add parameter, backup_type.
	* lib/backupfile.h: Remove extern declaration of backup_type.
	Use PARAMS, not __BACKUPFILE_P.
	(VALID_BACKUP_TYPE): Define.
	(find_backup_file_name): Adjust prototype.

1998-01-13  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

	* src/df.c (print_header): Fix inode format header to line it up
	with the rest of the output.

1998-01-13  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/stat.c: Set errno to ENOENT, not EINVAL.  This is consistent
	with most other implementations.

1998-01-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/fileblocks.c: Include sys/param.h only #if HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H.
	Move function-spanning `#if ...BSIZE' directive to follow inclusion
	of sys/param.h since BSIZE is sometimes defined in sys/param.h.
	Reported by Philippe De Muyter.

1998-01-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Version 3.16k.

	* src/install.c (install_file_to_path): New function.
	FIXME: update fileutils.texi.
	(main): Handle new option, -D.
	Based on a patch from Marty Leisner.
	(usage): Describe -D.

	* src/ls.c (decode_switches) [-u]: Fix bug whereby -u worked only
	with -l or -t.  Now, -u (like -c) implies --sort=time.
	(usage): Correct descriptions of --sort, --time, and -t.
	Suggestions from Andreas Schwab.

	Add test for the above fix.
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add tests/ls/Makefile.
	* tests/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add ls.
	* tests/ls: New directory.
	* tests/ls/Makefile.am: New file.
	* tests/ls/time-1: New file.

	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Reformat 3 if-stmts to test
	`if (newly_created_dir)' only once.  Suggestion from Andreas Schwab.

1998-01-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* lib/getdate.y: Move inclusion of getdate.h and dependent extern
	declarations down so getdate.h's prototype follows the sometimes-
	enabled definition of `const' to nothing.  Otherwise, the prototype
	wouldn't match the definition because of the defined-away `const'.
	From Kaveh Ghazi.
	(get_date): ANSI-fy definition.
	Add %expect directive.

1998-01-05  Andreas Schwab  <schwab@issan.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>

	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Put only newly created directories
	on the LEADING_DIRS list.

1998-01-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/fsusage.c (PROPAGATE_ALL_ONES): New macro.
	(get_fs_usage): If a value consists entirely of 1 bits,
	propagate this info to the output by setting it to (uintmax_t) -1.
	* src/df.c (df_readable): New function.
	(show_dev): If a value consists entirely of 1 bits, or is derived
	from some other value that consists entirely of 1 bits, report "-".
	Check inode and block counts more carefully for plausibility,
	to avoid arithmetic overflow when computing percentages.

1998-01-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Version 3.16j.

	* lib/Makefile.in: Regenerated with patched automake-1.2d.
	See README-alpha.

	* src/chgrp.c: Use a single enumerated type, Verbosity, instead of
	the two booleans, verbose and changes_only.  This fixes a bug whereby
	--change had the same effect as --verbose.
	* src/chmod.c: Likewise.
	* src/chown.c: Likewise.
	Reported by Paul Eggert.

1998-01-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Check for write errors more carefully.

	* lib/Makefile.am (libfu_a_SOURCES): Add closeout.c.
	(noinst_HEADERS): Add closeout.h.
	* lib/closeout.c, lib/closeout.h: New files.
	* lib/long-options.c (parse_long_options),
	src/chgrp.c, src/chmod.c, src/chown.c, src/cp.c, src/dd.c,
	src/df.c, src/dircolors.c, src/du.c, src/install.c, src/ln.c,
	src/ls.c, src/mkdir.c, src/mkfifo.c, src/mknod.c, src/mv.c,
	src/mvdir.c, src/rm.c, src/rmdir.c, src/sync.c, src/touch.c
	(main, usage): Check for write error to stdout before exiting.
	Include "closeout.h".

1998-01-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/df.c (show_dev): Treat `fsu.fsu_bavail == (unsigned long) -1'
	just like `fsu.fsu_blocks == 0' as an indicator that usage information
	is invalid.  This happens with Solaris-5.5.1 CD-ROM mount points.

	* lib/save-cwd.h: Guard PARAMS-enabling definition with
	`defined PROTOTYPES || (defined __STDC__ && __STDC__)' to avoid
	problems with Irix4's cc.  From Kaveh Ghazi.
	* lib/getdate.h: Likewise, but just to be consistent.

	* configure.in: Convert the .o suffix on files in LIBOBJS to $U.o so
	those files will be built via the ANSI2KNR-filtering rules if necessary.
	Reported by Kaveh Ghazi.

1998-01-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* Version 3.16i.

	Fix problem with `install -d'.  Reported by Marty Leisner.

	* src/install.c (get_ids): When otherwise unspecified,
	set uid and gid to -1.
	* lib/makepath.c (make_path): Try to change ownership only if we've
	just created the directory.  Fix latent bug (s/&&/||/ in two places --
	also, note that it could not be exercised via install or mkdir)
	whereby chown would not be invoked when only one of owner/group is
	not -1.

1998-01-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@na-net.ornl.gov>

	* src/rm.c (remove_cwd_entries): Initialize the entry-name obstack
	only once and never free it.
