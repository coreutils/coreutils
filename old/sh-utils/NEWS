User visible changes in release 1.9.3
* stty defaults `swtch' to undefined for Solaris so `susp' (^Z) will work.
  Before, with the default settings ^Z did nothing.
* stty no longer gives an error message when it finds a spurious difference
  (due to buggy tcgetattr/tcsetattr) between requested and current tty
  modes under SunOS 4.1.x.
* stty no longer fails if the ioctl to determine the display width fails
  when displaying settings.
* stty works around SunOS 4.x kernel bug that made `stty rows 0 cols 0' fail.
* who and tee no longer fail gratuitously when continued after an
  interrupted read or write system call.
* date accepts new format: %s time in seconds since 00:00:00 1/1/1971
* date -d can parse dates like `11-JUL-1991'
* expr '' == 0 works (before, it printed 1)
* stty no longer fails on telnet sessions to Solaris systems
* `cd /etc; who utmp' now works.  Before, any filename argument had to be
  absolute or relative to /dev.

User visible changes in release 1.9.2:
* who output is better formatted on Solaris and other SysVr4 systems
* fix a minor problem in formatting the output from `stty -a'
* yes with arguments outputs newlines again
* partial stty failures are reported

Major changes in release 1.9.1:
* stty can be built on Suns again
* minor fix for who -q

Major changes in release 1.9:
* su fails gracefully when getpass is unable to open /dev/tty.
* printenv and tty detect and report write errors
* fix bug in stty
* stty accepts the new options status and flush on systems that provide them
* `expr 1 / 0' gives an error message rather than trying to divide by zero
* expr's `substr' doesn't overrun malloc'd buffer
* expr recognizes the string `0' as zero
* better support for Linux, Dec Alpha, and SGI Irix
* all programs (even true and false) accept --version and --help options
* uname's --version option is no longer equivalent to its -v option
* configure uses config.h, so DEFS won't exceed preprocessor limits of
  some compilers on the number of symbols defined via -D.
* work around problem where $(srcdir)/config.h was used instead of
  ../config.h -- this happened only when building in a subdirectory
  and when config.h remained in $(srcdir) from a previous ./configure.
* make may be run from the subdirectories

Major changes in release 1.8:
* add echo command
* fix some incorrect warnings in pathchk
* look at the right utmp file on 386BSD
* date doesn't dump core on some systems now

Major changes in release 1.7:
* add su, who, true, false commands
* add more tests to expr
* fix printf program handling of \ escapes
* printf can re-use format string for multiple groups of arguments
* printf catches numeric conversion errors with an ANSI C library
* stty nl and -nl were backwards
* date can format an arbitrary date without setting it
