The preferred process for sending changes
is to email coreutils@gnu.org or bug-coreutils@gnu.org respectively.

## Developer resources

files containing information about contributing to GNU coreutils:
  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/HACKING
  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/tree/README-hacking
Please read them first.

Before suggesting a new feature, read the list of rejected features requests:
 https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/rejected_requests.html

Send a patch as an email attachment. Patches can be generated with
`git format-patch` (the HACKING links above provide examples of generating
a patch).


## Copyright Assignment

If your change is significant (i.e., if it adds more than ~10 lines),
then you'll have to have a copyright assignment on file with the FSF.
To learn more see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.html .

The HACKING file (above) contains more details about how to initial
the copyright assignment process.  Coreutils maintainers can also help
in this matter.
