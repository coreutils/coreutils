These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* Requirements

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the GIT repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges etc.), but imposes more
requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out sources.
For example, you have to use the latest stable versions of the maintainer
tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Bison <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Git <http://git.or.cz/>
- Gperf <http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Perl <http://www.cpan.org/>
- Rsync <http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>

Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> is also highly recommended, if
Valgrind supports your architecture.

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful.
Later, a plain `git pull && make' should be sufficient.

* LZMA

This package's build procedure uses LZMA to create a compressed
distribution tarball.  Using this feature of Automake requires
version 1.10.1 or newer, as well as the lzma program itself.
Make sure you have the latest stable version of the LZMA Utils
from <http://tukaani.org/lzma/>.

* First GIT checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:

	$ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils

The next step is to get other files needed to build, which are
extracted from other source packages:

	$ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

	$ git diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!
