# =================================================
# Ensure that we exercise the FIEMAP-copying code enough
# to provoke at least two iterations of the do...while loop
# in which it calls ioctl (fd, FS_IOC_FIEMAP,...
# This also verifies that non-trivial extents are preserved.

# Extract logical block number and length pairs from filefrag -v output.
# The initial sed is to remove the "eof" from the normally-empty "flags" field.
# Similarly, remove flags values like "unknown,delalloc,eof".
# That is required when that final extent has no number in the "expected" field.
