# Note if a group is not specified, install(1) will assume that a file
# would be installed with the current user's group ID, and thus if the
# file is the same except that it does have a different group due to
# its parent directory being g+s for example, then the copy will be
# done again redundantly in a futile attempt to reset the group ID to
# that of the current user.

#  install -Cv -m664 test/i1 test/i2 # install dest
#  install -Cv -m664 test/i1 test/i2 # again to see redundant install

# Similarly if an existing file exists that is the same and has the
# current users group ID, but when an actual install of the file would
# reset to a different group ID due to the directory being g+s for example,
# then the install will not be done when it should.

# Therefore we skip the test in the presence of setgid dirs
# An additional complication on HFS is that it...
