# Demonstrate that when moving a symlink onto a hardlink-to-that-symlink,
# an error is presented.  Depending on your kernel (e.g., Linux, Solaris,
# but not NetBSD), prior to coreutils-8.16, the mv would successfully perform
# a no-op.  I.e., surprisingly, mv s1 s2 would succeed, yet fail to remove s1.
