# that's unambiguous in BSD format.

md5sum --strict -c check.md5 || fail=1

# If we skip the first entry in the BSD format checksums
# then it'll be detected as standard format and error.
# This unlikely caveat was thought better than mandating
# an option to avoid the ambiguity.

## BSD traditional format tests (--tag option) ##

# We don't support --text with BSD tradition format,
# as that would complicate the output format,
# while providing little benefit over --text processing
# available with the default md5sum output format.
