# separating 36 hexadecimal strings, stty would fail to diagnose as invalid
# any number that was out of range as long as sscanf happened to
# overflow/wrap it back into the range of the corresponding type (either
# tcflag_t or cc_t).

# For each of the following, with coreutils-6.9 and earlier,
# stty would fail to diagnose the error on at least Solaris 10.
