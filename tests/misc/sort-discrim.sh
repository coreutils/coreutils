# These tests are designed for a 'sort' implementation that uses a
# discriminator, i.e., a brief summary of a key that may have lost info,
# but whose ordering is consistent with that of the original key.
# The tests are useful even if 'sort' does not use this representation.

# Test lexicographic sorting.

# A long-enough string so that it overruns a small discriminator buffer size.

# Test numeric sorting.

# These tests are designed for an internal representation that ordinarily
# looks at the number plus two decimal digits, but if -h is
# used it looks at one decimal place plus a 4-bit SI prefix value.
# In both cases, there's an extra factor of 2 for the sign.
# Note INTMAX_MAX is used below as that's that largest number
# expr can handle on all systems (without GMP).
