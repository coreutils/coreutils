The following loop translate the above @Tests to a Cureutils::run_tests()
compatible structure. It converts "OUTPUTS" key into "CMP" + "POST" keys:
1. Each element in the OUTPUTS key is expected to be an output file
   from csplit (named xx00, xx01, xx02...)
   create a "CMP" key for each one, with the output and the filename.
2. Add a "POST" key, ensuring no extra files have been created.
   (e.g. if there are 4 expected outputs, xx00 to xx03,
    ensure xx04 doesn't exist).
3. Add a "PRE" key, deleting all existing 'xx*' files.

Example:

Before conversion:
   my @csplit_tests =
   (
     ["1", '-z -q - 2 4 6',
       {IN_PIPE => "1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n"},
       {OUTPUTS => [ "1\n", "2\n3\n", "4\n5\n", "6\n" ],
     ]
   )

After conversion:

   my @csplit_tests =
   (
     ["1", '-z -q - 2 4 6',
       {IN_PIPE => "1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n"},
       {PRE => sub { unlink glob './xx??' ; }},
       {CMP => ["1\n",    {'xx00'=> undef}]},
       {CMP => ["2\n3\n", {'xx01'=> undef}]},
       {CMP => ["4\n5\n", {'xx02'=> undef}]},
       {CMP => ["6\n",    {'xx03'=> undef}]},
       {POST => sub { die "extra file" if -e 'xx04'}},
     ],
    );
