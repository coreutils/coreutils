# Without arguments, printenv behaves like env.  Some shells provide
# printenv as a builtin, so we must invoke it via "env".
# But beware of $_, set by many shells to the last command run.
# Also, filter out LD_PRELOAD, which is set when running under valgrind.
# Note the apparently redundant "env  env": this is to ensure to get
# env's output the same way as that of printenv and works around a bug
# on aarch64 at least where libc's execvp reverses the order of the
# output.
