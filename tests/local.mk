# Do not choose a name that is a shell keyword like 'if', or a
# commonly-used utility like 'cat' or 'test', as the name of a test.
# Otherwise, VPATH builds will fail on hosts like Solaris, since they
# will expand 'if test ...' to 'if .../test ...', and the '.../test'
# will execute the test script rather than the standard utility.

# Notes on the ordering of these tests:
# Place early in the list tests of the tools that
# are most commonly used in test scripts themselves.
# E.g., nearly every test script uses rm and chmod.
# help-version comes early because it's a basic sanity test.
# Put seq early, since lots of other tests use it.
# Put tests that sleep early, but not all together, so in parallel builds
# they share time with tests that burn CPU, not with others that sleep.
# Put head-elide-tail early, because it's long-running.
