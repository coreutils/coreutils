@command{fmt} prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to
avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last word
of a sentence.  A @dfn{sentence break} is defined as either the end of a
paragraph or a word ending in any of @samp{.?!}, followed by two spaces or end
of line, ignoring any intervening parentheses or quotes.  Like @TeX{},
@command{fmt} reads entire ''paragraphs'' before choosing line breaks; the
algorithm is a variant of that given by
Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass
in ''Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines'',
@cite{Software---Practice & Experience}
